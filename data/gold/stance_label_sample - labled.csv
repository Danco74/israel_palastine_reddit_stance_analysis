1ldo6o5,2025-06-17,IsraelPalestine,"Whoever continues calling people anti semitic to prove their point is entirely disrespectful. First of all let me start by saying Benjamin Netanyahu saying “Free Palestine” is the new “Heil H*tler” OH and he has said this many times, and reiterated that just generally saying “free Palestine” is today “heil H*tler.” Without nuance too, he’s said it many times . It’s so so gross and incredibly disrespectful to holocaust victims. Literally saying we want to save these people and help them is equivalent to we are pledging our allegiance to one of the most psychopathic genocidal maniacs in recent history is just utterly insane. That’s straight up playing a victim card constantly for absolutely no reason besides political gain. 

That’s just a tiny example though I just hate it when these words are stolen like that, which Semitic people? The ones in Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, or Israel? Calling someone anti semitic for supporting Lebanon is so incredibly ironic given that many of them have more ancient Hebrew dna than most Israelis. Just wow it bothers me when terms are taken like that and used for political propaganda, like the law of return should apply to all the Semitic people who have generational ties there or just none. Or don’t call it the “law of return” call it “we need to keep Israel predominantly Jewish!” it’s all so racist Jfc. 

Jewish people have no more right to that land. Israel exists, I find it disturbing when people say Israel shouldn’t exist too… but I can argue Israel’s apartheid and racism and the nuances there and the racism in certain places in the Middle East I know about, what I cannot even begin to grasp is people supporting the current Israeli administration, unless you’re ignorant or sociopathic or just don’t have access to information. They’re twisted and sick and they say it allllllll out loud. The politicians and soldiers constantly brag about their unfathomable cruelty and slaughter. 

Also people need to drop the whole omgaaawzh the homophobia in Palestine they’d juuuust kiiiillll youuuu maybe youuuuu should live theeeere! Its idiotic, one of the most patriotic things you can do is fight your countries government for your peoples rights! America is my homeLAND, meaning the nature, the people, the place I live, aspects of the culture, family NOT the government! Like lol one of my good friends grew up gay af in Lebanon lol. Many places treat LGBT poorly… it is sad, but when a country isn’t allowed to progress they’ll never become progressive, many older ideologies will not change in an oppressed, occupied or brutalized country. As far as Palestinians go! lol they’ll just be grateful for food. 

Openly LGBT people went to Palestine and everyone was incredibly pleasant and grateful. The dehumanization of Arabs is so well done in the US and Israel it is insanity. It’s raaascisssssm. The buzz terms, human shields, suicide bombers, terrorist. All while Israel is being just as brutal and sometimes far more brutal and on a larger scale. Not to say LGBT rights are just fine and dandy in Lebanon or Palestine or Jordan or whatever. But many places were or are like that now too. You cannot hold back a society from progressing then pinkwash to get the gays on your side while also completely not allowing that society to progress. 

Afghanistan was doing far better in the 70s, until OH, lots of that decline was caused by US intervention. Just completely decimate a place then act like you’re the righteous ones because you can get railed in the butt by another guy, like America has the illusion of freedom and free speech. That entirely depends on where you are, who you’re dealing with, judges, cops, affluent people, what class you’re in. Saying oh we let gay people have sex so we are saaaao free while just ravaging the planet for power and resources is sick. 

Yes there is a large issue of homophobia in the Middle East.,. And Africa… parts of Asia… right now more than in a long time the US has some granted far more minor issues with LGBT peoples. Much of this anti LGBT rhetoric stems from colonial times in the first place!!!! Just take the country over teach them to hate gay people, entirely stunt their society and then get upset they’re homophobic?! WHAT!? lol.",anti,pro,

War is pointless. War is a trick. Palestine is not to blame because of a select group. Israel is not to blame because of a select group.

War is the result of being angry and not walking away to collect your thoughts, use common sense, and use your empathy. 
It doesn’t matter who started it. It doesn’t matter who did what up to this point. Forgiveness and humanity is all that matters now and there has to be someone to remind everyone that. 
Change my mind. Or better yet, don’t. For once, don’t try to debate or come up with a different solution. Actually imagine, regardless of what sides, innocent children dying. Dying from a bomb. Dying from a gun. Dying from starving. Dying from infection from a piece of shrapnel and no medical care soon enough. Dying from fear because yes, that happens. 

If you are reading this post and you are on either side of this war and being traumatized and suffering yourself, imagine someone else on the other side in your exact same position. Because that’s literally the reality. Your sides children are suffering, their sides children are suffering.

That being said, he absolutely outted Basseem's emotionally ridden and childish understanding of the Israel/Palestine conflict. Baseem usually ran away from pretty softball questions and when pressed on it, the best that he could provide was ""I don't know"" or try to make pretty malleable equivalcies, he tried the pompous sarcastic demeanor here too and tripped over himself.

Baseem's arguements were all packaged with ""Civilians dying is bad"" which is pretty agreeable right? But when Konstantin presents him with examples in the past like the bombing of Dresden and how it was neccesary to defeat the evil of Nazi Govt. of Germany. Baseem flatly says its wrong but fails to provide another alternative solution....He continues on by doing the same hyperbolic strawman of ""the world doesn't see Arabs as humans so there death count means nothing"" so he doesn't have to get into the nitty and gritty ""proportionality"" arguements.

Nonetheless, I thought he was a change of pace from the usual voice in mainstream media regarding the conflict but his world view and understanding is very infantile and he is unable to provide any ideas beyond complaints.

The meme I made is mine, the pictures are not mine, I found many of these online, and they all go to their respective places. 

Anyway, to today’s Non Credible take:

Improvising.

Ukrainians are the definition of improvisation, they can field test stuff and use their brains to test it. There have been a few Diamondback DB-15 rifles in Ukraine as seen with these images, what does this tell us? Ukrainians are proving that you don’t need “Gucci AR’s” to fight. Do you know how to use the tool? Can you maintain it? If all is yes, then you are fine, you don’t gotta be a TactTard.

Holosuns are now being combat proven in Ukraine. These Chinesium optics have been used on both sides. The Ukrainians are ESPECIALLY taking advantage of these optics because of how cheap and durable they are. These optics have been popular down here in the United States for pretty much the same reason. You can submerge it in water and scuff it all up, and it still will work just fine. These things also can hold zero and handle almost any firearm you put it on.

Now for the fun one:

DRONES!

DJI Drones are kinda in the same boat as Holosuns. They are cheap and durable, these drones while they are common for hobbyists and YouTubers to use for their vids. These drones have also found a use for scouting and tracking, as well as being useful for drone warfare. Yes some people have used them before for drone warfare in Ukraine.

The ""Chief General"" dares to tell us ""it'll be unforgiveable"" if we enter Rafah.  
For the last 16 years Hamas got billions of dollars and has been empowering itself under the flag of UNWRA.  
Hamas slaughtered every living thing on sight and took as many as it can hostage to hold as trophies, they killed our men, women, children and even babies.  
You expect us to accept the fact that our people is in their dungeons and sit it out while negotiating with an evil terrorist organization?

Those terrorists have hijacked the biggest hospital in Gaza and right now are barricading themselves in, using it as a base of operations. They are attacking our soldiers from inside while also hitting the hospital itself. Hiding behind sick and wounded people while destroying their own hospital with no regard for those who really need it.

Our IDF has been operating in Shifa for a while and untill now, did not hit a single patient in the hospital while eliminating and arresting terrorists who attack our soldiers from places like the maternity ward and emergency rooms which they are fighting from right now.  
IDF tries its best not to hurt the innocent by trying to move them as much as possible from harms way.  
So far the IDF has brought dozen of medical devices, 10,000 units of medications, hundreds of medical supplies as well as food, water and other essential equipment to the Shifa hospital.

I would like to hear what you guys think of the line up, are you happy with the people representing your side? are you happy this is happening? do you think it can achieve anything?

&amp;#x200B;

My thoughts:

I lean pro Israel and I think the pro Israel side is very well represented, for many reasons. Both Benny Morris and Destiny are not extremely pro Israel, they are anti the occupation, anti the settlements, Benny even signed a letter that called the Westbank an apartheid. For this reason, I think they can appeal to a large audience and get many on their side. 

Benny Morris' historical knowledge is excellent so that's always useful but his debating style is essentially nonexistent , that's where I think Destiny complements him really well. 

I think Destinys strengths is in the debating, he follows the conversations, the narratives, the flow really well. If someone is being dishonest and avoiding a question or switching the goal posts, they will not get away with it with Destiny. He may be one of the best I have seen at this.

Finkelstein is someone I think that relies on poor debate opponents so he can use slight of hand, false equivalences, poor sourcing, weak argument construction etc. I think he will likely hate being in the room with Destiny.

Rabbani, I do not know about, but from the little I have seen, uses the same arguments as Finkelstein so the pro Palestinian side has no diversity.

1fn42ti,2024-09-22,IsraelPalestine,"Realistic “day after” plan? The only ones who have attempted to make a feasible day after plan for Gaza are Yoav Gallant and the UAE

The UAE’s foreign envoy wrote an op-ed which can be found here: (paywall)
https://www.ft.com/content/cfef2157-a476-4350-a287-190b25e45159

Some key points:

* 		Nusseibeh advocated for deploying a temporary international mission to Gaza. She said this mission would respond to the humanitarian crisis, establish law and order, and lay the groundwork for governance. 
* 		The UAE would be ready to be part of such an international force and would put boots on the ground.
* 		The international force would have to enter Gaza at the formal invitation of the Palestinian Authority. 
* 		The Palestinian Authority would have to conduct meaningful reforms and be led by a new prime minister who is empowered and independent. 
* 		The Israeli government would need to allow the Palestinian Authority to have a role in governing Gaza and agree to a political process based on the two-state solution.
* 		The U.S. would have a leadership role in any ""day-after"" initiative.

The current proposal for Gaza's ""day after"" raises several significant concerns, especially when considering the region's complexities.

The UAE's suggestion of deploying an international mission, backed by humanitarian and governance goals, sounds like a necessary step. However, some critical issues need to be addressed:

1. Security Guarantees for the International Mission: Any force deployed to stabilize Gaza would need strong security assurances. With the remnants of terror networks, criminal groups, and the likelihood of extremist elements regrouping, how can we guarantee the safety of international personnel? This is especially important if hostilities continue, or if rogue factions, possibly linked to Hamas or other militant groups, see the mission as an occupying force.

2. Palestinian Authority's Capability and Reform: The Palestinian Authority (PA) has long struggled with issues of corruption and inefficiency. The ""pay-to-slay"" policy, which financially rewards those who carry out acts of violence against Israelis, is just one example of how the PA is far from implementing ""meaningful reforms."" Even if there’s international pressure, what happens if the PA refuses to let in a humanitarian mission? Will this lead to a further power vacuum or empower alternative groups, even extremist ones, like Hamas 2.0?

3. U.S. Involvement without Boots on the Ground: While the U.S. might play a consultation role, it has shown reluctance to place troops in the region. Consulting and training from afar may not be enough to enforce stability. So who leads the initiative on the ground? If it's an Arab-led force, how will those nations ensure they're not seen as betraying their fellow Muslims by cooperating with Israel?

4. The Philadelphi Corridor and Egypt's Role: The porous border between Gaza and Egypt has been a long-standing issue. Egypt’s negligence or complicity in allowing weapons and resources to flow into Gaza cannot be overlooked. What’s to stop new militants, weapons and supplies from again coming through the same channels, reinforcing terrorist groups and undermining any international mission?

5. Israel's Deterrence and Security Needs: Any day-after plan must ensure that Israel feels secure and that its citizens aren't under the constant threat of rocket attacks or terrorist incursions. How does Israel establish deterrence to prevent a resurgence of militant groups, especially in a scenario where international forces might limit its military operations?

The plan has a lot of idealistic elements, but the realities on the ground suggest it needs to address these key points to have any chance of success. Without addressing them, we risk recreating the same conditions that led to Gaza becoming a base for terrorism in the first place.

People in Gaza like people everywhere are fundamentally decent and irrespective of current bias and education have the ability to surpass their environment and develop into a wealthy liberal democracy.

Obama and Biden have both given BILLIONS of dollars to the IRGC—money that Trump shut off—and, frankly, these decisions are in many way to blame for October 7th, as they are Hamas’s biggest backer. Just this past week, Biden signed another deal unfreezing billions for the IRGC to spend on Hamas, Hezbollah, and of course executing women for not wearing a hijab correctly.

I am tired of being silenced when I point this out. I am TIRED OF IT. I LITERALLY HAD THIS REMOVED FOR MISINFORMATION WHEN I TALKED ABOUT THIS ON A MAINSTREAM JEWISH SUB. There are official White House documents!! Yet every time I try NOT to throw Iranians under the bus I am silenced and reminded of Joe Biden’s so-called “unwavering solidarity to Israel” when it has very much wavered! 

Here are examples of very significant wavering:

1) Biden calling Israel’s response “over the top”
2) Biden removing the Houthis from the terrorist list upon taking office
3) Biden having CAIR, which literally came from the muslim brotherhood and has been a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UAE since 2014, on anti hate commisions including the “strategy to combat antisemitism”
4) Biden’s mouthpieces repeatedly conflating antisemitism and islamophobia when they are completely different and have not increased at all the same amount
5) He has Robert Malley on staff. His head of Palestinian Affairs, Hady Amr, is openly pro-Hamas.
6) He made the United States UNWRA’s biggest donor.

I could go on…

And now he’s saying they can’t go into Rafah WHICH IS WHERE MOST OF THE HOSTAGES ARE BEING HELD.

In what way, in hell, has Biden’s support for Israel been unwavering?!

Yet ANOTHER whistleblower who served on the ground is coming forward detailing how Israel is murdering children in cold blood. 

This is what I truly don't understand about people who are STILL somehow denying the genocide at this late date. How can you have the audacity to claim to know more than both the victims AND the perpetrators witnessing this atrocity first hand on the ground? How can you dismiss eye witnesses and claim that they're wrong while you sit comfortably behind a computer screen elsewhere in the world? It doesn't make any rational sense. 

I often have brought up in this sub the countless eye witness accounts of people who survived Israel civilian massacres and saw their family members and friends gunned down and blown up right in front of them, and often the response is randomly accusing these people of being Hamas, when you don't even know them! Dozens upon dozens of eye witness accounts casually dismissed because ""something something Hamas!"" No further critical thinking required. This is not how any court of law or system of evidence works in any context.

But fine, ok, you don't value the human experience of Palestinians and you label them all terrorists - so are the IDF Hamas? Are American mercenaries like this man Hamas? How can even THEIR testimony be dismissed so flippantly? The testimony of whistleblowers who are seeing this atrocity and these war crimes daily. What on Earth would make anyone think they have a better grasp of the situation than the people who are seeing it happen in real time, mere feet in front of them? It defies all rationality. 

Please listen to this man and the people like him who are desperately sounding the alarm. American soldiers, IDF soldiers, doctors, white helmets, journalists - ALL of them are telling you and showing you its a genocide. It's unacceptable to still be denying it. We should be well past the point of acknowledging that it's happening. The debate now should be entirely about how to end it, but somehow nearly two years in we are still denying genocide as babies starve and children eat sand to try to quell hunger pains.",anti,pro,
17tozvt,2023-11-12,IsraelPalestine,"The blood is on their hands I hear the phrase, ""the blood of the Palestinians are on Hamas's hands,"" a lot and to some degree I agree. When Hamas attacked on Oct 7th, killed all those people and took hostages there was no way Israel would just let it go. Any country in Israel's position would retaliate to get their hostages back.

Yet, as a watch the destruction and devastation causes by Israel's response, I think it is also important to recognise that there is blood on Israel's hands too. Yes, Hamas effed up big time and yes, Israel needs this group out of the region to protects its people, but this military reponse is Israel's choice, not something they are forced to do for several reasons:

1. They want to mentally and physically exhaust the population so they are too defeated to fight back.  
2. They are purposely causing the most destruction to infrastructure, again so people dont have the resources to fight back
3. It kills targets without putting Israeli lives at risk
4. Israel wants to push their ground invasion forward with minimal resistance
5. They want to establish a permanent security presence in Gaza 

Remember Hamas is fighting from their [tunnel systems](https://time.com/6332051/gaza-city-israel-ground-offensive/), this bombing doesnt damage anything under ground.

18iwlgu,2023-12-15,IsraelPalestine,"I don't understand why Israel doesn't want a 2 state solution I'll preface by saying I'm evaluating from a realpolitik perspective, and trying to find flaws or misunderstandings in my logic. It's obvious that indefinitely occupying arabs in gaza and the west bank forever is untenable politically and political pressure will increase over the next few decades  
First, I believe the below statements to be true

1. Israel will be moderately successful destroying hamas infrastructure over the next 3months-1year and their ability to launch large scale attacks will be significantly degraded. Increased preparedness also makes the risk of another large scale attack unlikely.
2. Palestine will never pose an existential military threat. geographically Gaza and the west bank are small territories with a small population that can easily be defeated with air superiority in a conventional war.
3. The largest risk to Israel is political. They need to maintain their support from the US as well as continue to normalize with the Saudis/UAE/Jordan/Egypt and counter Iran. It is very clear that Palestine is gaining support with the younger generation and will continue to do so, which is a major risk to Israel 20-30 years down the road if they lose western support and face economic sanctions like SA or Rhodesia
4. Israel will lose the propaganda war. Muslims outnumber Jews 120:1 and coupled with anti-western states (Iran, China, NK) they can dominate social media algorithms to push favorable narratives and control the facts. Having influence with mainstream media has declined in importance, and honestly the truth of what happened on Oct7 or what is going on in Gaza now is irrelevant. Just reading twitter you see people believing stating that the IDF killed most of the civilian on Oct7, the hostages were treated well, and the IDF has lost thousands of soldiers and hundreds of vehicles in Gaza.
5. Israel doesn't have to negotiate a 2 state solution, they can simply create one. Israel can finish their operation in Gaza, withdraw settlements from the west bank, and say they recognize the independent republic of Palestine overnight. No negotiation or a deal, just let the west bank and gaza govern themselves with 0 assistance or oversight.

Now, lets assume Israel takes this isolationist approach to gaza and the west bank and leaves them to self-govern. This includes allowing them to have a military, and removing settlements from the west bank. This would hurt economic growth in the short run, but this is a price worth paying. removing settlements in the west bank today would be a gambit to eventually take them back 10+ years from now after a defensive war.  


1. You now disarm the main criticism of occupation and apartheid, which ultimately reduces the largest  existential risk to Israels survival which is declining political support internationally
2. There is some chance eventually Palestine figures out how to become a functioning state on their own, which is good for Israel
3. Most likely Palestine will eventually be controlled by extremists who will build up their military and attack Israel. Even if they were able to inflict 10 times the casualties of Oct7 on Israel, this would be an opportunity to fight a justified large scale conventional war against a neighbor state. This scenario could allow them to annex parts of the west bank and Gaza and gain territory in an internationally justified way.

I'd love for someone to explain why this long term strategy doesn't work and what the biggest flaws are. I'd imagine the biggest issue is domestic Israeli politics, as publicly admitting this strategy would invalidate it and short term factors tend to get in the way of long term strategy in a democracy",neutral,neutral,

1cfczlp,2024-04-28,IsraelPalestine,"From my experience Israelis and Palestinians look alike! They’re the same shit just different toilets.

They’re half brothers cuz their great grand daddy is Abraham, but they have different great grandmas; Sarah (Sarai) and Hagar (Hajar). Israelis and Palestinians is Isaac and Ishmael.

From what I remember Sarah told Abraham to bust a nut inside Hagar (Egyptian maid) cuz Sarah couldn’t bear a child, hence, Ishmael was born (the Arabs).

But 10 years later, Abraham busted a nut in Sarah and Isaac was born (the Israelites). Then one day when Isaac’s dick was getting cut off (circumcised), Ishmael was mocking his lil bro’s lil dick.

Sarah got mad and told Abraham to banish Hagar and Ishmael from their home, so Isaac can be the sole heir. So Hagar and Ishmael was like fuck it we out Abe.

God promised both Isaac and Ishmael great nations and followers of their tribes. Guess what!?

Ishmael - 22       Isaac - 1

Ishmael has 22 Arab countries including Palestine while Isaac only has 1, Israel.

Isaac is pissed off cuz there’s 22 Arab countries and only one Israel and they’re fighting their right to exist cuz it’s God’s plan.

Ishmael is like look Isaac, you can come back home in Palestine and even call parts of it Israel, but we have to live in harmony cuz we’re half brothers. You can’t just come and take what you think is yours. I was here first, I was born first. You weren’t even suppose to be born, but pops had to bust a nut in yo momma Sarah and you came out lil bro Isaac.

Isaac is like you know what Ishmael, if you’re going to be like that, I’m going to control the money and you can go control the oil, but remember that I’m still controlling your money from your oil, big bro Ishmael, so if you talk shit I’m cutting you off like Kanye West and tell your brother Palestine to move in your countries cuz we’re taking over here.

Isaac reminds Ishmael that when someone crosses the line, they’re anti-Semitic that’s why they killed Jesus Christ. Hamas crossed the lines, not Palestinians, so they dropping bombs fasho and that’s why they keep dropping bombs.

Half of Hamas are not even Palestinians, they’re from other radical groups trying to train Palestinians. And the good people of Palestine have no choice cuz no other rich ass wealthy ass Palestinians around the world who left Palestine are coming back to replace Hamas with a new government.

The hate between two half brothers is deep and it aches me to watch the two brothers fight to death when there has been one historical peace moment between Isaac and Ishmael when they shook hands for the first time in human history on September 13, 1993.

Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat shook hands. A right wing Israeli/Isaac named Yigal Amir then assassinated Yitzhak Rabin, their own people. Since then, Israel has been ruled by the right wing party, hence, what you’re seeing today which has been going on since the death of Yitzhak Rabin.

It’s possible to have peace in the Middle East, but it takes good people to achieve this and not bad people. The world sums down to good people versus bad people, not Israelis versus Palestinians because there’s good and bad people on both sides.

Unfortunately, there’s more wealthy bad people than wealthy good people on both sides of Issac’s and Ishmael’s lineage, so you won’t really hear from the good side nowadays.

 [ICC Seeks Arrest Warrant for Israeli PM Netanyahu — Viktor Orbán: Absurd and Shameful Decision](https://www.hungarianconservative.com/articles/current/benjamin-netanyahu_icc-warrant_israel_hamas_viktor-orban_joe-biden/)

The International Criminal Court (ICC) is seeking arrest warrants for Hamas leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity, ICC prosecutor Karim Khan revealed in an exclusive interview with CNN on Monday.

Khan stated that the ICC’s prosecution team is also seeking warrants for Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant as well as two senior Hamas leaders: leader of the Al Qassam Brigades Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri and political leader of Hamas Ismail Haniyeh.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán—a close ally of Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel—also criticized Khan’s decision, calling it ‘absurd and shameful.’ ‘Such initiatives will not bring the Middle East closer to peace, but only fuel further tensions,’ PM Orbán wrote in a post on X.

The United States reacted similarly. President Joe Biden on Monday [described the move as ‘outrageous’.](https://www.reuters.com/world/biden-says-icc-move-arrest-warrants-israeli-leaders-outrageous-2024-05-20/) ‘Let me be clear: whatever this prosecutor might imply, there is no equivalence—none—between Israel and Hamas. We will always stand with Israel against threats to its security,’ Biden said in a statement.

It is important to note that neither Israel nor the United States is a participant in the Rome Statute, which established the ICC in 2002. This means that the court has no jurisdiction over their territories. However, the ICC claims to have jurisdiction over Gaza, East Jerusalem, and the West Bank after Palestinian leaders formally agreed to be bound by the court’s founding principles in 2015.",anti,neutral,

We once had a lemon tree in our home garden in gaza, lovingly planted by my dad. It was more than just a tree it was a source of joy, shade, and endless possibilities for adventure. Climbing its branches, picking fresh lemons, and sharing them with family and friends are memories I hold dear to this day.


Unfortunately, the lemon tree did not survive the 2008 war. Its loss left a void in our hearts, but we were determined to turn tragedy into growth. In its place, we planted a berry tree a symbol of resilience and hope amidst the ruins of war.


For years, the berry tree thrived, bearing fruit that filled our home with sweetness and reminded us of the strength of our spirit. But the harsh reality of war once again took its toll, and the berry tree fell victim to the devastation of the 2023 war.


That berry tree, was the beacon of revived hope in our garden, symbolized not just my family's resilience, but that of our entire community. It's now our generation's task to transform this new loss into a wellspring of replenished hope. Yet, I find myself consumed by despair, wrestling with my role amidst this chaos.


The reality hits hard. There’s an overwhelming sense of helplessness that creeps into my bones, at times evolving into self-directed resentment. How did the previous generations manage? I catch myself wondering. They faced wars and losses just like us, yet they seemed to harbor an unbreakable spirit, an unwavering hope that spurred them to rebuild time and again. How did they wear those brave faces, and where did their seemingly endless well of hope come from?


I yearn to draw from that same well of hopefulness that fueled my ancestors. But dark thoughts cloud my mind: is it just me, or is my generation not as strong? Or perhaps, is that well of hope that has nourished the Palestinian spirit for so long finally nearing its drought?


I'm exhausted. While I've inherited the resilience that runs deep in my bloodline, I've also inherited the pain and the trauma that comes with it. The weight of continuing a legacy of strength feels daunting, and I fear being the one in my lineage to falter.


But then, there's a flicker of determination, a whisper of a prayer. I hope I can find an answer to this painful riddle, to not let down the generations before me. I pray that Allah grants me strength, just one more time, to push through. To find a way to plant a new seed of hope in the scorched earth of despair—not just for my family, but for every Palestinian struggling to see past the rubble of their current reality.


Remember us in your prayers.

the first scenario is that a free palestine looks like a post-apartheid south africa. the occupiers are not expelled, but are encouraged to integrate into a democratic society without apartheid. the right of return for palestinians is instated and houses are given back to those they were stolen from, those who have committed war crimes are of course punished, west bank settlers with western citizenship are deported, etc, but generally the population of israelis are allowed to stay in the country, vote, participate in public life and practice their religion. some or many will dislike no longer having the privileges that come with being the top of the apartheid state and will emigrate, just as nearly a million white south africans have in the past thirty years, but many more will be able to integrate into a genuinely free and democratic society. this would sound ideal, but i don't think it takes into account just how racist the israelis are, nor the bitterness and distrust that will inevitably be felt by palestinians; i know i for one would not be particularly keen to be neighbors and sing kumbaya with the people who killed thousands of my people in the recent past. there is a reason that german jews did not return to germany en masse after the holocaust, etc.

the second scenario is that ""from the river to the sea, palestine is arab"" is taken literally, and all jews except the descendants of the native population that existed pre-zionism are expelled from the country. this would eliminate the problem of having to live among people who have abused you for a century, but raises problems in that most israelis do not have foreign citizenship and many of their ancestors all immigrated from different countries, including those who were refugees themselves and cannot safely return to their families' countries of origin. i doubt they would be welcomed warmly into any country which has allied with palestine. i suppose the united states could take them?

and then, it seems, there may be a more realistic ""middle"" scenario, in which all those with foreign citizenship or whose parents/grandparents immigrated from someplace safe are encouraged to return to their countries, and all the rest are encouraged to join a post-apartheid society. still, though, this does not eliminate the issues of living alongside those who have recently perpetrated settler-colonialism and genocide against you. i suppose there are a few examples of this historically (kosovo, rwanda, bolivia) but they seem... tenuous.

Regarding how to respond to the Houthi attacks on the Red Sea, I've mentioned before that I suggest the U.S., China, and Saudi Arabia come together to woo the Houthis with significant incentives. For example, internationally recognizing the Houthi government, establishing diplomatic relations, allowing the Houthis to attack the remaining Yemeni territories, lifting all economic sanctions on the Houthis, jointly investing in infrastructure in Houthi areas, and even allowing the Houthis to continue direct strikes on Israeli territory, etc. All these in exchange for the Houthis not attacking the Red Sea. Seems like the U.S. might've gone swinging the big stick without dangling these carrots first.

Honestly, with the state the U.S. is in now, they should be wooing and uniting with astonishing efforts before even thinking about brandishing the big stick. Why am I making such a suggestion? The benefits here are actually pretty substantial.

If you start with amazing offers, you get to talk for a few rounds, right? During the talks, you can find out a lot about the other side. Have no doubts, given America's current level of cluelessness, they probably don't have a clear picture of many organizations. A few rounds of negotiations and contact would at least allow you to identify potential compromisers; you can slowly watch how the willing and unwilling fight it out and observe how they reach a consensus internally. You can also potentially drive a wedge between the organization and its allies (for instance, in this specific example, causing potential suspicion between the Houthis and Hamas, as well as between the Houthis and Iran).

Even if negotiations break down and you have to resort to the stick, at least you've probed their firm stance before doing so, eliminating any illusions that ""a little push and they'll fold."" Conversely, not having such illusions can also reduce the risk of acting rashly on your part. And after swinging the stick, you still want to leave room for further compromise and negotiation. If you don't feel out the situation beforehand and plant some seeds in the hearts of those potentially willing to compromise, your follow-up negotiations won't be easy.

Some might say that if the U.S. offered the conditions I suggested to negotiate with the Houthis, the domestic opinion wouldn't stand for it. I'm aware of that, which is why secret diplomacy is essential. As long as you stick to secret diplomacy and dismiss any leaks as rumors, the public will gradually get used to this new political norm—after all, they're no strangers to similar situations in other areas. What the U.S. really needs now is the resolve and perseverance to engage in secret diplomacy.",neutral,neutral,

1j5u01n,2025-03-07,IsraelPalestine,"Deploy 1 million troops into Gaza THIS IS MY OPINION on a brilliant plan to end the Israel Gaza conflict. Hopefully by the grace of god president trump will see my plan and act. Trump will win a Nobel peace prize. 

As soon as all hostages are released, we need to break ALL promises made to Hamas. Once the hostages are gone that is our opportunity to let loose. They are terrorists and they act in bad faith so we must do the same. 

I love Palestinians and I do not want a single innocent civilian to lose their lives. My plan will help change their lives for the better and history will look back and appreciate what we have done. 

First step: DEPLOY 1 MILLION US TROOPS INTO GAZA and give them the FULL backing of all of the US military. Everything they need. SURROUND GAZA WITH AIRCRAFT CARRIERS. Drop flyers over major population centers and evacuate all civilians into luxury condos built in Egypt near the border with GAZA. Absolutely flood this safe zone with food medicine, entertainment and fun things like theme parks and water parks and luxury housing, all temporarily subsidized by Arab nations and US taxpayers until we rebuild the economy. The us troops must heavily assist with transportation for sick and elderly. If people don’t leave offer them money + promote the luxury condos and amenities they will get in Egypt. Literally their living situation will be 10x better than average Egyptian standards. Build schools and educate them with western values. Eventually this SMALL tiny piece of land on the GAZA border will be absorbed into Gaza as a donation from Egypt (truly very small and already alongside Gaza).

If Palestinians stay in Gaza they will stay radicalized living under Hamas. It’s an awful place to live. They need to get out of that environment because it causes radicalization. Get away from the death, destruction and war. Everybody just wants to have a good life in the end. There is no good life in Gaza at the moment. The people must be separated from Hamas and shown how good life can be without Hamas. 

Once ALL civilians are given the opportunity to leave Gaza, we must go wild on Hamas. Ground penetrating MOABs, special forces tunnel operations, ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING to completely end Hamas’s ability to fight. There must be a complete siege with no food, water or electricity. It will take a few years but anyone left will be broken and defeated. 

Once the fighters are cleared, get the army core of engineers to bulldoze all the rubble. Use economic warfare (tariffs) to strong arm companies into investing in Gaza in the same way they have in the USA. I’m talking TSMC fab plants, Ford manufacturing, walmart stores, iPhone plants in GAZA. Force so much investment into Gaza that their economy will be booming. Once all these companies begin investing that’s when the real estate developers will start building. Hire world renowned city planners, and collaborate to make Gaza the riviera of the Middle East. Rebuild universities and force collaborations (professor sharing) with Ivy League schools like Harvard and Yale.

Then allow Gazans to slowly move back into Gaza, while the land is policed by U.S forces (with sensitive training on civilian policing). Once they see the beautiful land we have given them, their hate will disappear. They will have jobs and beautiful land and western educations. After a decade or so of living like this write a constitution similar to what we did for Germany/japan- but we can only do this once the population is deradicalized  after a few years of living a rich western life style rather than a terrorist, death filled cesspit. 

There will be a gold statue of Trump in GAZA and many will view him as a god. He will certainly win a noble prize once the plan begins to be executed.",pro,anti,
18mcil2,2023-12-19,AskMiddleEast,"Why is the expulsion of Jewish populations from neighboring Arab countries as a reaction to establishment of Israel used as an anti-Palestinian argument by Zionists? Sincere question, as I can’t really understand what it has to do with the debate as it concerns the contemporary political situation. The only reason I can think of is an arbitrary lumping of all Arabs together and collectively punishing them for the decisions of dead leaders of long defunct governments. 

The standard Zionist refute of the Nakba is the apparent “850,000” ethnically cleansed after 1948 in Yemen, Morocco, Iraq, etc. Many Arabs simply refuse the premise and suggest that these populations were pulled to Israel for positive reasons, rather than expelled. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.

But my question is, even if we accept that they were expelled by Arab governments, what does it have to do with Palestinian people? Why are Palestinians seen as responsible for the decision of other Arab governments? Because they fought on the same side of the war? So what? Were these Arab leaders asking for the opinions of every Palestinian before making these decisions? 

As far as I know, they did this on their own volition, so it has nothing to do with the political contradiction as it pertains to Israelis and Palestinians, but rather a purposeful blurring of lines between the Arab/Israeli conflict and the Israeli/Palestinian conflict which are not always synonymous. Palestinian refugees are not responsible for the cruelty of other leaders and I wish this argument would die. Why would they even support this, seeing as these expulsions further accelerated the usurping of their self-determination as these migrant Mizrahis became Zionists?",anti,pro,

That being said, this is an edited version of my last post which may or may not receive another warning. Cheers.**


Say what you want about how I feel about them. I don’t think I am alone in feeling this way about them. I’d even go as far as to say that I think anyone who feels this way is actually normal and in touch with reality. Not everybody deserves empathy and sympathy. I don’t think it’s evil to think this way. I think such things need to be earned, not given.

Giving empathy and sympathy to those who simply don’t deserve them is not cute or healthy. It doesn’t make us elevated individuals or whatever delusional nonsense they want us to believe. It makes us permissive and soft on stances we should be firm on. It makes us blur the lines on where we should stand. 

In this case where Palestine has been going through a gradual ethnic cleansing and genocide since the 1940s that is as clear as day, we don’t get to pussyfoot and act so confused. Either we are against the premeditated rape, murder, land theft, colonialism and imperialism, or we’re totally fine with it. 

That being said, it is clear where I stand. I can’t and don’t feel sorry for Israel and its people. I never have and never will. I have a strong aversion to them because they have shown themselves to be a fundamentally rotten and evil society. I understand that it’s “not all Israelis” who condone this. I also understand that those who do condone and encourage what’s happening to the Palestinians are not a fringe minority, but a mainstream majority. 

Many of them believe that they’re “God’s chosen people” and that they are entitled to commit the most atrocious evils in the most narcissistic, entitled, audacious fashion. Many of them believe that the destruction in Gaza is not enough. The average Israeli “civilian” terrorizes Palestinians in the West Bank with the backing of the IOF. Most notable of all, they invaded Rafah right after Holocaust Memorial Day, of which the purpose of such day is to proclaim “Never Again” just to commit “Again” the day after. 

This evil is so normalized that it’s enshrined in their policies and reflected in their cultural attitudes. They even got their children joining in the destruction of humanitarian aid and spewing out some of the most atrocious rhetoric at hate mobs. 

I am not only averse to them, but I also feel a deep, bottomless, inconsolable disappointment. Everything about them induces a visceral reaction of disgust whenever I see them and their wretched flag. It is honestly insane to me how a population can act so overwhelmingly vile. I honestly understand why many Jews nowadays denounce and divorce themselves from Israel and its people, because it truly is a terrible time to even be remotely associated with such an embarrassment. 

The state of Israel should not have been created. We shouldn’t have to be forced to live side-by-side with them after what they have shown themselves to be, nor should the Jewish people all across the world feel obligated to pledge allegiance to such toxic waste. 

Their country is nothing but an extension of western colonialism and imperialism that thrives off of the rape, murder, and theft of innocent Palestinians. It’s an aggressive, malignant system of terror plaguing the Middle East that needs to be dismantled for the sake of humanity and all that is good. Dare I say it is an extension of the very same entities that allowed for the Jewish people to endure unjustified persecution and mass killings in concentration camps.

We have no reason to be fine with Israel’s existence if this is what their existence requires. They never were intent on living peacefully and it was understood since day one that to establish such country required terrorism. It was understood that their country’s founding must be done at our expense.

They had the nerve and audacity to come into Palestine as refugees post-Holocaust, pleading to not have their hopes destroyed. Now they claim so proudly that they’ve turned a barren desert into a thriving country, and that either we were primitive sand-dwellers who made no use of the land or we simply didn’t exist as a people. They say they beautified our land when anyone with a functioning pair of eyes can see that they’ve turned it into a dystopian nightmare with all these bleak walls, checkpoints, and settlements inhabited by an obviously foreign people with ugly hearts.

They have the nerve to paint themselves as permanent victims and make it look like their ugliest crimes are simply trauma responses to the Holocaust, like the Holocaust somehow justifies what they’re doing. I’m so sick and tired of hearing about the Holocaust and the awful mental gymnastics it takes to justify the unjustifiable. I honestly just don’t want to hear about it anymore because they’ve made it a horrendously boring excuse rather than a historical reminder to bear. It is honestly so disgusting how they use the genocide of their own people to justify ours. Innocent Jews did not die to be used as an excuse for genocide. 

I’m also sick and tired of the painfully obvious enablement of their psychotic behaviours, especially by the Western world. We’re told the encampments on university campuses make Jewish people uncomfortable, despite the fact that there are many Jews at the forefront of protests nowadays. If they are so uncomfortable by such sights on university campuses, they can look the other way like they do with genocide committed in their name. 

I feel no sorrow for the Israelis. I don’t feel sorry for a people who didn’t care when Gaza is being bombed, when humanitarian aid is proudly being blocked and destroyed, when the West Bank is being brutally occupied by their own people with the backing of their own government. They did not care when they planned the creation of their wretched ethno-state. They did not care about the suffering they would inflict and the lives they would ruin. 

As they are apathetic and even proud of the suffering they cause, I am as apathetic to the suffering they endured on October 7. Many of us saw this coming because we knew they had it coming. The international community has failed spectacularly in bringing about justice, and Israel has received nothing more than a slap on the wrist for their unapologetically blatant barbarism that deserves more severe repercussions. It is precisely the same international community that allowed for this cursed partition plan to even become a reality, which created this breeding ground for Zionist Western depravity. They left us all to perish and lose everything. 

It brings me satisfaction to see them scrambling and fighting amongst themselves internally. Externally, the world is waking up and seeing them for what they really are. They see Zionism for what it really is. Humanity rejects a people who justify the unjustifiable evils they support and refuse to condemn. 

Now that they’re all crying and throwing a tantrum about the rise of “anti-Semitism”, the lives they lost on October 7, the Iranian attack on Israel, they expect our tears? What do they want us to do? Condemn the attack and coddle them like they didn’t just engineer the most inhumane conditions against us that allowed for such attacks to emerge? Like they didn’t purposefully want Jewish identity to be inseparable from Zionism for selfish propagandistic purposes? Do they want us to feel bad for them and weep for their loved ones, as if they likely weren’t soldiers who took part in house raids, harassments at checkpoints, kidnappings, bombings, and rapes against the Palestinians? 

Israel and its people are delusional to believe they deserve any drop of sympathy, for nothing they have done allows for them to receive such sympathies. If anything, they deserve to be shunned and shamed for the evils they proudly support and for putting well-meaning respectable Jews in danger. May the consequences of their actions finally catch up to them.

However, while it is no less obvious that assaulting Israel is only one step in a delusional, but still dangerous Ikhwan Islamist agenda of comprehensive conquest and subjugation of disbelievers (in supremacy of Islam), I think that we do not yet hear this message as we should. For 2024, I wish to see this message become another cornerstone in our public conversation in Europe.

Hamas, the one dedicated franchise of the Ikhwan Islamist ideological network to target and murder Jews, has always stated that their target are Jews all over the world. Their manifests in pointing their targets make no distinction between Jews in Israel and other Jews. The broader Ikhwan ideological network has always stated that their target are all non-Muslims on the entire planet. 

In 2023, the two state antagonists of our European civilization, Putin-Russia and Erdogan-Turkey, were humbled and their position in a spiral of decline reinforced. We should now with all due dedication and perseverance rise to the occasion and make 2024 the year where we can say the same thing about the transnational antagonists of our European civilization, Ikhwan Islamists.

Just like the existence of Ukraine is an ultimately lethal thorn in the side of Russian supremacism, the existence of Israel is an ultimately lethal thorn in the side of Ikhwan Islamist supremacism.

On Oct 7–&gt; Gaza’s military initiated a land invasion murdered raped and took hostage As many people as possible without concern (as opposed to idf having to deal with gazas human shield issue resulting in collateral). If the iron dome or idf didn’t come (and yes they came late) it would have been complete genocide of Israeli people. Then in Gaza the streets are celebrating this and Gazas government approval shot up a lot after raping and killing. If gazans protested against Hamas for release of hostages yes but at this point, the Hamas/UN run education system led to anti semitism ingrained in the young generations who have been taught selective history without context . UNRWA school have more or less been an Arabic hitlers youth. 

 I think people are insane in thinking the Israeli people should be expected to want an independent Palestinian state. Maybe before but now there is no trust that independent statehood wouldn’t leak to more rapw and death. You are not going to allow people who promote death and rape of Israel&gt; peace to self govern. If so, Hamas will survive and regroup due to the antisemitism education ingrained in gazans (and West Bank education is really antisemitic too). 

The reality is, Israel has reached an understanding—&gt; Palestinians cannot currently govern themselves and will likely be unable to for 20ish years. Their upbringing currently makes them unable to live in peace with Jews and will perpetual attempt to destroy Jews unless a major education overall occurs without the anti semitic un or Palestinian run school systems and Palestinians are under security control to ensure Hamas or Hamas like groups won’t be able to amass. And with this aid could actually be allocated to Palestine untilke now where it’s leaders harbor it",pro,anti,

18l8x2k,2023-12-18,IsraelPalestine,"How Israeli Violence Radicalized Hamas On Dec. 9, 1987, an Israel Defense Forces truck driver struck and killed four Palestinians near the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza. During protests that ensued the following day, Israeli soldiers fired aimlessly into a crowd of Palestinians, killing 17-year-old Hatem Abu Sisi and wounding 16 others.

The result was a spontaneous, leaderless uprising. Palestinians in the OT descended to the streets in daily protests, boycotts and strikes in what would become known as the Intifada—or ""the Uprising."" During its first year, the Israeli military killed 142 Palestinians in Gaza without suffering a single casualty. By 1991, Israel had killed 706 Palestinian civilians, while Palestinians had killed 9 Israeli civilians. The Occupied Territories had transformed into a Palestinian slaughterhouse.

The Uprising came on the heels of 20 years of military occupation after Israel annexed East Jerusalem and occupied the West Bank and Gaza following the June 1967 war. During this time, Israeli forces killed, on average, 32 Palestinians every year, demolished more than 1,000 Palestinian homes and confiscated hundreds of thousands of hectares of land. It denied Palestinians the right to have a say in the government that controlled their lives or the permit regime that suffocated their economy. 

It denied Palestinians the right to organize protests, publish newspapers, wave Palestinian flags, or paint artwork made of red, green, black, and white. Palestinians were constantly made to feel humiliated in their workplaces and made to feel unsafe at military checkpoints. And so they revolted.

When the First Intifada broke out, Hamas, an acronym that means the Islamic Resistance Movement, was not called Hamas. It was still known as the Islamic Collective, or al-Mujamma' al-Islami, founded in 1973. Initially, the Collective was established as a mosque, medical clinic, youth sports club, nursing school, Islamic festival hall, zakat committee, and centre for women's activities and training young girls. 

By the 1980s, the Islamic charity organization operated a network of mosques, medical centres, health clinics, food banks, soup kitchens, summer camps and schools across the West Bank and Gaza. It dedicated its efforts to helping the Palestinian poor and preaching Islamic piety.

But when Palestinians in the Occupied Territories established a Unified National Leadership (al-Qiyada al Muwhhada) after the outbreak of the Uprising to mobilize grassroots support, the Islamic Collective felt pressure to participate in the most significant challenge to Israel's occupation to date. And so the group was remade and named Hamas with a new foundational charter, published in August 1988, that adopted new forms of Jihad, including armed struggle. And so, after 300 Palestinians had already been killed since the start of the Intifada, Hamas carried out its first operation against an Israeli military target, killing two Israeli soldiers, in February 1989. 

A few months later, on May 2, 1989, when asked about its violent embrace, Hamas founder Ahmed Yasin said, ""What is the other alternative available to those who cannot regain their rights by peaceful and non-violent means?"" Yasin argued that the Palestinian people preferred peaceful resistance to violence to achieve its goals, but he explained that the Israeli military only understood the language of force.

Yasin was arrested shortly after that and sentenced to life in prison for the operation. Then, on June 6 1989, Israeli prison authorities forced Yasin to listen to prison guards beat and torture his son, Abdul Hamid, in Gaza's Central Prison. Their goal was to extract a confession from Yasin for having established Hamas's military wing and for having ordered the killing of the two Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military managed to extract a confession from Yasin under duress. They also managed to push the movement even further down the road to violence. 

The next turning point in Hamas's evolution came in October 1990, when the right-wing Israeli organization Temple Mount Faithful announced it would lay the cornerstone for a Third Jewish Temple in Jerusalem at the holiest Muslim site in Palestine, the al-Aqsa Mosque. Palestinians organized a protest against the threat, during which the Israeli military police killed 17 unarmed demonstrators. Two months later, on Dec. 14, 1990, Hamas stabbed three workmen to death in Jaffa. They claimed it was a direct response to Israel's grotesque violence. 

For the next few years, Hamas fighters directed most of their attacks against Israeli military targets, including a May 1992 attack on a high-ranking Israeli police officer in Gaza, a July 1992 attack on Israeli soldiers in the Old City of Jerusalem, and an October 1992 against a military camp next to the Mosque of Abraham in Hebron, among others. 

Then, on  Feb. 25, 1994, on the Jewish holiday of Purim, the Brooklyn-born Baruch Goldstein entered the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron, a Palestinian city in the West Bank. He threw a hand grenade at worshippers kneeling for Ramadan prayers. Then he squeezed on the trigger of an automatic Galil rifle, killing 29 worshippers before he was overtaken and beaten to death at the scene. 

The massacre was the trigger that ignited a reign of terror of the kind Israelis had never seen before. Six weeks later, Hamas committed its first planned suicide bombing attack. Raed Zakarneh drove a bomb to a bus stop at Afula and detonated it, killing eight Israelis and injuring 44.

This was only the beginning. From 1994 to 2005, Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants used their own bodies as bombs, killing more than 1,000 Israeli civilians in hundreds of attacks and wounding thousands more.

In the late 1990s, Nasra Hassan, who worked as a humanitarian relief officer in Gaza, interviewed hundreds of Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants. When asked if they had any qualms about killing innocent civilians, they would immediately respond, ""The Israelis kill our children and our women. This is war, and innocent people get hurt."" In other words, it was not a time immemorial hatred of Jews, or a time immemorial hatred of the Jewish state, or a time immemorial belief in violent Jihad that radicalized Palestinian militants. Instead, it was Israeli violence, especially against unarmed Palestinian civilians, that pushed Hamas militants to commit so many gruesome attacks against innocent civilians after 1994.

All of this leaves one horrified at the thought of what will likely result from Israel's unrelenting assault on Gaza over the past two months, which has left at least 18,600 people dead, some 70% of them women and children. ""Our children, in 10-15 years, will make nuclear bombs in their house and will wipe out Israel,"" said Ali Ahmed Qudeh, a resident of Khuza'a, near Khan Yunis, as he pointed to a Palestinian boy who saw his father and his uncle die before his very eyes in November 2023. ""He saw his stolen house, he's living in a tent…how can we remove hatred from the hearts of these children?"" 

History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme. Israel's long-standing policy of disproportionate and indiscriminate violence has had a radicalizing effect on Palestinian militant groups. One shudders to think how many more Palestinians have been radicalized in the past two-months, and how many more will pick up arms in the months, years, and decades to come as a result.",anti,pro,

18xfko4,2024-01-03,IsraelPalestine,"""An eye for an eye"" is a valid stance. Both jews and muslims have the right to it. After ww2, there is a famous group called ""Nakam"". ""Nakam"" refers to a group of Jewish partisans who sought revenge against Germans and collaborators after World War II. They planned to poison the water supplies of several German cities. However, their plot was discovered, and they were arrested before carrying out their revenge. 

Nakam was driven by a deep sense of anger and frustration over the atrocities committed during the Holocaust. Many of its members had lost family members and friends in concentration camps, and they felt that the perpetrators of these crimes needed to face direct consequences. The group was particularly incensed by the fact that some former Nazis were able to escape justice or were involved in post-war reconstruction efforts.

Abba Kovner, the leader of Nakam, was a prominent Jewish partisan during the war and played a crucial role in organizing resistance against the Nazis in Eastern Europe. His experiences and the horrors he witnessed fueled his commitment to seeking vengeance. The group's plan to poison water supplies was intended to deliver a message of retribution on a large scale.

While the Nakam operation was thwarted, it sheds light on the complex moral and ethical questions that emerged in the aftermath of the Holocaust. The survivors faced the challenge of reconciling their desire for justice with the legal and political complexities of the post-war era. The story of Nakam is a poignant chapter in the broader narrative of Holocaust survivors grappling with the aftermath of immense tragedy.

Similarly, muslims have the right to carry out jihad for their religion. 

Muslims must fight to take revenge on the jews and jews should also fight to take revenge on the muslims. And it is okay to do that. Why is it okay ? Because the number of lives lost in the war is a small fraction of the total population of israel and palestine anyways. 

So if a small group of people want to get even they have to right to get even. It is okay to take revenge for the blood that has been shed. Also, it does not matter who wins this war simply because even if palestine loses this war still history will remember them as brave Islamic warriors who sought revenge against the Jews. And being remembered by history is enough considering that the other Arab oil rich muslim nations have betrayed them.",anti,pro,

This started as a reply in another thread about the left and Israel/Palestine but got so long I felt compelled to make a post. I don’t really have anyone to talk with in-depth about Israel and Palestine in meatspace since the topic can be so divisive. If this ends up being a bunch of insane hyperbolic and ignorant rambling I apologize in advance and hope you were at least amused.

Some intro to explain my perspective on things, skip over if you’d like. I think/thought of myself as leftist. Was close to graduating high school when 9/11 happened, opposed both Iraq and Afghanistan wars before they started. Was disgusted by the torture and illegal imprisonment and horrified that so many of my fellow Americans could support or glorify such a thing.

Always supported equal rights causes of course. Started off very liberal and moved a little further left as I grew older. I firmly believe Capitalism will lead to humanity burning itself out if a viable alternative is not found. Infinite growth is not sustainable without infinite resources. Society needs to incrementally adjust to a new standard to avoid any catastrophic collapses.

I don’t consider myself a patriot though there is a lot I love about America. A lot I don’t. But for better or worse I’m American. I want my country and countrypeoples to be prosperous, just not at the expense of others. Not religious and don’t think less of anyone who is.

Think of myself as both pro-Palestine and pro-Israel. I realize that I’m going to be unconsciously biased towards Israel as I have little exposure to Arabic and Palestinian culture and media. Along with the innate differences between American and Arabic peculiarities. I’m at least somewhat familiar with the history, aware of the Nakba and other wrongs.

Prefer to read the news instead of watching it. Avoid anyone with a cult of personality surrounding them. I don’t consume any form of political entertainment like streamers or podcasters. Don’t use TikTok, NotTwitter or any social media besides reddit. I’ve avoided viewing graphic media of deaths on both sides, the descriptions are more than enough for me.

**Begin rant.**

The conflict is not just Israel and Palestine. The onus for peace is put entirely on Israel for having significant military and economic advantages over Palestine. It ignores the virulent antisemitism in countries surrounding Israel and their past history of anti-Zionist holy wars. Key countries such as Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have made steps towards peace, but the balance is precarious and no more holy wars occurring cannot be guaranteed at this time.

The far-left dismiss the toxic influence of foreign hostiles, especially Iran, funding and arming and training multiple terrorist groups with the explicit purpose of eliminating Israel and killing every Jew. That other countries are sheltering the top leaders of Hamas and facilitating smuggling of rocket building supplies, weapons and money into Gaza.

They diminish the martyr culture and the financial incentives that are provided to kill Israelis. There’s no recognition that regardless of one’s personal thoughts, millions of people who hear Free Palestine, think free from Jews. And the lion’s share of those millions are living near Israel.

Then there’s the frenzied rhetoric about Israel intending to kill children. Not that they just don’t care about their deaths, but that they want dead kids and it’s a goal for them. It all builds to a conspiratorial climax where the evil Jews are sacrificing Palestinian children in order to create their pure ethnostate. Honestly makes me think of blood libel.

The hyper focus on the numbers of deaths oversimplifies the conflict into a scoreboard for a game. Doesn’t account for fog of war and the possible exaggeration of deaths by Hamas authorities. I know their casualty reports have been verified to be mostly accurate in the past, but if there was ever a time for Hamas to cash in on the small amount of credibility they actually have, it would be now. It’s also probable that some deaths of Hamas fighters are being passed off as civilians.

The death disparity argument also minimizes Hamas’ war crimes of using human shields. The use of civilian infrastructure to launch rockets, making that location a legal target. There’s no accounting for Israel’s efforts to protect Israelis with bomb shelters, the Iron Dome and the wall around Gaza (a problem for later but it has been effective at reducing attacks within Israel.) The score would be far more even without those things.

Consider the mental psyche of a human being capable of dropping bombs on innocents vs personal and intimate torture, murder, rape and kidnapping. Envision what it would really be like to experience either fate for yourself or your loved ones.

This is a crass analogy, but imagine you had to pick between two people for a new room mate. One of them is a bomber pilot and shares direct responsibility for the deaths of hundreds of innocent civilians. Other’s a mass murderer who tortured, raped and murdered a family of five. And filmed it all and posted it online. Who’s your families new roomie?

I’m seeing things from the left that I used to notice from the right. Smarmy “cool it with the antisemitism” remarks. Insinuations and accusations of Jews controlling the media to spread lies and cover up the real truth.

A narrative that the enemy is simultaneously strong and weak. Where the IDF are elite over-equipped super soldiers who shouldn’t have any difficulties fighting some plucky underdog. But they’re also cowardly soft weaklings who can only fight against children despite their technological superiority.

That Mossad and other agencies know everything and have perfect intel with an army of spies deep undercover, and can assassinate anyone anywhere. They have near total knowledge and control of everything happening. When October 7 likely occurred due to a long series of bureaucratic and political failures, critical operations mistakes and key opportunities that were either fumbled or were just too elusive to be exploited or discovered.

Assuming Mossad could get the Hamas leaders overseas, it would be a diplomatic catastrophe to assassinate a Palestinian political figure in Qatar, even if they are a terrorist leader. Qatar is a valuable conduit for diplomacy and great location for secure peace talks. 

It would also be borderline impossible to accomplish. Hamas leaders are well connected billionaires with no shortage of dangerous people willing to kill or risk death for them. It’s not like some elderly ex-camp guard in South America.

People egregiously overstate Israel’s capabilities and assume any failures must all be part of some nefarious and devious plan to steal more Palestinian land. There’s 9/11 style conspiracy theories where the Israeli powers-that-be either allowed or even helped October 7 happen so they would have cause to annex Palestine afterwards. Conspiracies that the IDF are the ones actually responsible for killing most of the Israeli civilians.

Ironically the western far-left diminishes and trivializes to the point of absurdity the actual threat and danger that Hamas works so hard and struggles so much to be. I think it stems from a desire or need to pile extra damnation onto Israel for being too oppressive and needlessly violent to support their preferred conclusions.

Additionally they project their own privileged western worldview onto people who have a different set of values as a result of very different life circumstances and conditions. 

This will be kind of absurd, but not-to-seriously imagine being a proud Hamas revolutionary warrior.

Born into hopeless strife and despair. Your soul has aged far more rapidly than your body. Barely a man and you already feel old.

You’re stuck inside the elaborate maze of cramped tunnels that used offer protection and safety, but now that your foe is on top of you they trap and confine you like a rat. You trained so hard your entire short life to prepare for this decisive fight against a bitter enemy.

Standing a lonely watch at some important location deep underground while your compatriots fiercely battle and rage above. Breathing in the stale and solemn air anxiously awaiting another earth shaking, wall cracking explosion that could occur at any moment. You can’t stop thinking about how will you inevitably join the venerable multitude of martyrs in paradise. Does it hurt more to get shot or to be blown to bits?

How much more time do you have before destiny finally leads you inexorably to your gruesome and glorious death. Will everything you’ve fought for crumble to dust and debris, will everyone you’ve loved and lost vanish into the past? Is anybody going to be left alive to miss you, to even remember you? Did your life mean anything? You have doubts for the first time if you chose the correct path.

Then some stereotypical privileged western far-leftist revolutionary poser awkwardly scoots sideways towards you in the narrow underground corridors. A formidable belly is scrunched up embarrassingly flat against the wall. Even in the darkness you can see greasy pimpled skin.

There is more scraggly hair growing from his neck than on his cheeks. He is so pale that his ghostly flabby flesh glows like a jiggling moon from even the meager amount of light reflected from your dim lantern.

His shirt says “Free Palestine” in rainbow colored letters with a picture of gangsta Che Guevara smoking a blunt beneath. When you make disbelieving eye contact, he excitedly shouts in English “From the river to the sea bro I’m here to rescue Palestine from those cr*cker Zionists!”

Allaheus ex machina intervenes and you can suddenly understand him. This is a curse! He keeps brushing unwashed and unkempt stringy purple hair behind his pierced ears. It’s not quite long enough to stay tucked and comes loose whenever he moves his head. Which he does while he talks. And he never stops talking. Allah what have you done to me!

This weird nerd just blathers on obliviously. He can’t understand you at all, but keeps saying “Salama Alaicum” and trying to fist bump you. Every time you take a step back, he steps in close again. You don’t know it, but his shoes are limited edition Air Jordans that cost over $1,500.

His breath stinks and you can’t stop looking at the generous portion of blubbery gut that sticks out the bottom of his ill-fitting novelty T-shirt. He speaks confusingly of the futility and meaninglessness of your passionate resistance while behaving like your good friend?

On and on he goes. Saying that despite all of your sacrifices and commitment to threaten your great nemesis into capitulating, you actually pose a totally meaningless threat to Israel. Not even dangerous enough that they can morally defend themselves from you. You’re so weak and ineffectual that Israel retaliating would be like an adult cruelly beating a small child for misbehaving.

All those rockets you and your buddies labor to build and launch are effortlessly swatted from the sky like flies by an invulnerable iron titan. No hope of success at all and the hospitals and schools you launch from are blown up a minute later. Like bro, why do you even bother? Israel barely notices.

All that effort and loss so some carefree Israeli could be mildly annoyed by the warning sirens and keep browsing pictures of their latest vacation on their new iPhone. Your childhood best friend who was martyred attempting a brave if foolish attack on the IDF after his little sister was murdered by soldiers? Toothless little lion who was only playing a little rough.

You? A pitifully adorable jihadi who sorely needs some sanctimonious western savior, some meme-brained know-it-all-from-TikTok effeminate douchebag to rescue your helpless warrior self from mean ole Israel.

In the midst of the onslaught of verbal vomit the bizarrely strange man says that he has a husband! Allah would not torment a faithful servant so, this must be some kind of shaitan trick! You mercifully shoot the decadent and depraved interloper dead. Finally, some peace.

That might have got a little excessive I apologize. Also, I’d like to hear what the leaders of Hamas would say of far-leftists crediting Jews with their creation and success.

The western far-left put their own biases and grievances onto this conflict, but they still align with their radical counterparts on an Islamist pan-Arabic originated mythology of Palestine that is founded on an occasionally ahistorical past; which chronicles ancient grudges, facts, half-truths, and some arguable falsehoods.

The story of Palestine was written long-ish ago and is as unalterable as the Qur’an. Evil Jewish foreign invaders came in and genocided the Good Palestinian people living there and stole everything they’d built. There is a long period of suffering but after an unwavering holy struggle all the evil colonizers are removed by the heroic resistance fighters and blessed shaheeds. Palestine is finally free of oppression and it’s people live happily ever after.

There is a demand for any type of action, even if it doesn’t serve a productive goal. Stresses must be relieved to prevent a breakage of self. It’s part of what leads people, even otherwise rational people into acting so irrationally that they recklessly attack a much stronger foe. The overwhelming frustration and desperate desire for something to happen *now* invariably leads to violence.

It’s quick and satisfying and diplomacy is slow and exasperating. It gives hopeless people who have precious little control over their living conditions and future a way to feel like they aren’t completely powerless. There are also perverse financial incentives involved that must be highly alluring to someone with poor employment opportunities trying to provide for their family. 

Any criticism of Palestine is treated as being treasonous. There’s an obsession with some malevolent Jewish plot, in this case to steal more land and genocide Palestinians. Radicals are hostile to anyone even trying to stay neutral. The status quo favors the oppressor, so pacifism is derided and dismissed as a viable option as long as diplomacy isn’t working well enough to satisfy. 

Just to note I’m going down the 14 point list of Umberto Ecos essay Ur-Fascism [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism#Umberto_Eco). Please don’t give much weight to the word fascism, that’s a whole other discussion I’m not trying to get into. This is long enough as is. I’m using the content as a convenient framework for thought and reflection.

Israel is mythologized as being founded and populated by white and European immigrants and their descendants. Foreign colonizers who stole indigenous land to create an ethnostate. A modern day echo of Apartheid and naked apparatus of pernicious western imperialism. This narrative is used to heap disproportionate blame onto Israel for all of Palestine’s many miseries. And Israel does share considerable responsibility for them, but certainly not all.

The notion of decolonizing Palestine. Presuming that one believes most or even all the land belongs to Palestine, decolonization of Palestine is necessarily genocide of Israelis, primarily Jews, by definition. Israel has a legitimate, non-colonial claim to exist there too.

The rigid application of hierarchy and power theories to the chaos of real life results in some kind of underdog voodoo where the oppressed remain powerless even as they eradicate their oppressors.

The finer points of power disparity and what constitutes justified resistance, are lost on an individual human being that is being brutalized by their theoretical inferior.

From a western far-left perspective, freeing Palestine is folded into the greater resistance against western imperialism, which is a fair enough thing especially historically. Some of that sordid history is quite relevant to this ongoing conflict.

There’s also the standard support of equitable human and workers rights. Can’t make much of a living if the means of production get bombed every week. The conflict is interpreted as a revolutionary overthrowing of colonizing oppressors and opposition to western imperialism that any proper leftist must logically support.

Just going to quote directly from Ur-Fascism on these next two. First is about martyrs. Will note that the western far-left either ignores the martyr factor, downplays its significance and influence, or maybe even support it. Ironically or not.

&gt;”Everybody is educated to become a hero,” which leads to the embrace of a cult of death. As Eco observes, ""[t]he Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death.""

Next one is geared more towards the radical Islamist side of things.

&gt;Machismo, which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere. Fascists thus hold ""both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.

The section about selective populism doesn’t seem particularly applicable to the Palestinian cause as several leaders and factions all have varying goals and approved methods. However there is a bit there related to delegitimizing democratic institutions.

This is still worth noting because even though it’s not a situation where the will of the people is subverted in favor of one individual, the radical Islamist element still confers an underlying rejection of certain western ideals, chiefly secular democracy.

Last section is about newspeak.

&gt;Employing and promoting an impoverished vocabulary in order to limit critical reasoning.

Potentially productive discussion is easily sidelined into the definition of certain words (e.g. genocide or apartheid.) Or the conversation just fails there. I’m right you’re wrong, Go My Team. This devolves into insults and mockery if one attempts to continue, just to spitefully waste time and annoy. An act of petty defiance.

Discussion that isn’t 100% in favor of Palestine and 100% against Israel is rendered socially unacceptable. One of the most complex, long lasting and morally gray conflicts that’s ever existed. With a vast array of competing domestic and foreign interests, endless legitimate grievances on both sides, the conflicting religious underpinnings, and the outcome being a life or death matter for potentially millions.

Nope, nothing more to reason. Couldn’t be incorrect about a single thing.

And when any further discourse on the matter is rejected, a simple solution to the complex problem emerges. If only Israel ceased to exist, everything would be good. The preordained happy ending to the mythologized and sanctified story of Palestine.

October 7 has had a significant effect on shifting discourse but I’d like people to remember that far-left and liberal are very different. For Jewish people I know there’s a sense of betrayal from the left and uncertainty about how reliable an ally the left really is.

I worry about the shock and fear resulting from the October 7 massacre empowering the far-right, in Israel, America and even worldwide. It’ll be used as evidence that they’re correct and Islamophobia really is “facts and logic” so to speak.

It works and I can’t totally fault most people for it. The thought of something like October 7 happening where you live should scare you, how could it not? But it all feeds into the endless cycle of hate and violence. 

As far the US is concerned, Biden and a large majority of Democrats firmly support Israel. Much to the chagrin of the electorally marginalized American far-left. No part of that equation is going to change anytime soon. All I’ll say about Republicans is that a certain one individual is not going to soothe tensions in the area.

I don’t really know enough about Israel’s politics to say much except that Netanyahu needs to be removed from authority as soon as Israel is out of crisis mode. And then be thoroughly investigated for many reasons.

After October 7, Hamas has to go. Not just because of the excessive brutality of the attack, but the deceit involved utterly obliterated the nanoscopic particles of trust and good faith that may or may not have still existed.

The abuse by Hamas of some kibbutz workers to reconnoiter and help guide the attack. False talk of wanting to improve Gaza’s economy. Fewer Hamas led attacks. All phony overtures towards deescalation that worked all too well to lower Israel’s guard.

Hamas has made it clear that dead Palestinians are more valuable to them and to their cause than life itself is. They vow to repeat similar attacks again and again. Zealots don’t like to surrender. Hamas will not run out of international support to be wielded as a weapon against Israel.

The Gazan people are in no position to overthrow Hamas and it’s not fair to put such a difficult task on their shoulders. A lot of them also probably don’t really want to and it’s kinda hard to blame them. They have suffered tremendously and Israel is responsible for more than it’s fair share of it.

The only way to remove the cancer that’s stealing the life-force out of Palestine from the inside, Hamas, is by force. No other country wants to do it obviously, so the task falls upon Israel.

And I’ll acknowledge here the twisted support and conniving exploitation of Hamas by the Israeli far-right. If Israel played a part in Hamas’ success then it’s fitting that Israel should be the one to get rid of them.

They of course have a duty to cause as few civilian deaths and injuries as possible. To always act legally. To act morally as often and as much is humanly possible given the circumstances of war against an entrenched, radicalized and highly dedicated opponent that callously utilizes innocent human shields.

There must be a strong post-war rebuilding effort to replace infrastructure in Gaza along with people’s homes and businesses. Improvements should also be made in the West Bank. 

Needs to be a dismantling and safe evacuation of the West Bank settlements. But there will have to be some type of security assurance from Palestine that these areas will not be used for military purposes.

There needs to be a truth and reconciliation committee established so that wounds can be healed and dignity and respect can be restored, diplomatically.

The announcement coincided with the arrival of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Budapest, where he is set to meet with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.



Under the Rome Statute, which established the ICC in 2002, Netanyahu would technically be subject to arrest by Hungarian authorities, as an international warrant has been in force against him since November 2024. However, Hungary stated at the time that it would not comply with the warrant. In line with that position, Orbán invited Netanyahu to visit the country, calling the decision of the Hague-based court ‘absurd and shameful’. He has now become the first leader of an ICC member state to host the Israeli prime minister since the warrant was issued.



Minister Gergely Gulyás confirmed that Hungary will initiate the formal termination procedure on Thursday, in line with constitutional and international legal obligations.



As previously reported by Hungarian Conservative, Viktor Orbán allegedly instructed three of his ministers in May 2024 to examine the potential consequences of Hungary leaving the ICC’s jurisdiction. At the time speculation was already circulating regarding a possible warrant against Netanyahu.

My name is Sarah. I am a mother from Gaza living through one of the harshest chapters any family could endure. For over a year and a half, our lives have been turned upside down by a devastating war that reduced our homes to rubble, turned our streets into ghost towns, and transformed our children’s dreams into never-ending nightmares.

Today, more than 90% of Gaza is destroyed. There is no clean water, no sufficient food, no safe shelter, and no jobs. My husband walks miles every day to reach a clay oven in hopes of finding bread — often moldy, or full of worms and insects.

We cook on open fires in primitive conditions, and the water we drink is contaminated. We carry it from far away, and though it tastes bitter, we have no other choice.

My son, Samih, is an innocent child who only knows life through the lens of fear. He cries day and night, asking to go outside  but he doesn’t know there is nowhere left to play. He has fallen ill from malnutrition and constant trauma. We can no longer meet even his most basic needs.

My husband is unemployed. There are no opportunities, no resources. For the past year and a half, we have survived solely through donations from the link in our Reddit and Instagram: https://gofund.me/997d2d8c. Despite this, we are censored on every platform and must go to great lengths to expose the most vulnerable parts of our lives in order to gain sympathy. I never thought I would come to rely on social media in this way, but if it’s what I have to do to help my family survive then I am happy to be here.

Every bit of help means the world to us. Please, help us secure food, medicine, and clean water for our son Samih. Be the light that brings us hope in this darkness.

Why haven't the isreali forces already entered the hospital? What is preventing isreali forces from completely taking the hospital over if there are no militants inside or under or nearby?

1gm8zh1,2024-11-08,IsraelPalestine,"Hamas started too early, October 7 was supposed to be an ALL IN attack together  Hi,

I knew October 7 was to happen someday in the future, but I didn't think it'd happen that early. I thought at least by 2025 but not 2023. Hamas messed up Iran's plan to shock and destabilize Israel One day, Iran planned the attack, as I like to call it, the Day of Judgement, where 10s of thousands of missiles are sent into Israel from Hamas, Hezbollah, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and Iran itself, together with Israeli Arabs and the West Bank, let the party begin. This could've ended with 100,000 Israelis dead, a million Israelis injured, and at least tens of thousands of Israelis kidnapped just in one day. 

On the day of the attack, in the first 30 minutes, I was watching the TV regarding the news, and I thought to myself, Where is Hezbollah??? Why isn't Hezbollah starting as well? What happened? This wasn't in the plan. Hamas saw an opportunity and took it but I am pretty sure they regret it now, as well as Iran is probably very angry at Hamas for destroying their Day of Judgement Plan

Now, both Hamas and Hezbollah are getting destroyed, and they have awakened Israel, so now there is no more waiting time/ceasefire since Israel will attack whenever they want, not like before when they let Hamas and Hezbollah build rockets and plan, the time is over and I think Iran just doesn't know what to do except continue building their nuclear capabilities. Hamas and Hezbollah have been able to build their power every day since 2006, but now the days are over, and I am pretty sure Israel won't let them build up near the border anymore.

1n5o79s,2025-09-01,IsraelPalestine,"Is the International Association of Genocide Scholars antisemitic? How do we interpret 86% of their members calling Gaza a genocide? First, legally speaking nothing is a genocide until it is decided in court, and to date Israel is under investigation but not guilty. Second, I understand that the word genocide in this sub can shut down discussions, but that is not my intention. It is to ask how different sub members interpret this, and how they think others should interpret, or dismiss it. 

The International Association of Genocide Scholars (IAGS), which is the leading global body of academics in this field, just voted on a resolution regarding Gaza. 86% of the members who voted supported declaring that Israel’s actions meet the legal definition of genocide, as well as constituting war crimes and crimes against humanity.

IAGS has about 500 members worldwide. They haven’t released the exact number who voted, I tried to look it up, but their bylaws require a two-thirds majority of participants to pass a resolution. With 86% support among those who cast a ballot, this easily cleared that threshold. So while we don’t know the turnout, the approval rate among voting scholars was overwhelming.

The resolution cites UN casualty figures (59,000+ killed, actually out of date, it's over 63,000 now), destruction of 90%+ of housing, famine conditions, repeated displacement, and statements of by Israeli leaders that are often cited about 'flattening Gaza' or treating Palestinians as 'human animals.' It also references ICC arrest warrants and ICJ rulings that found genocide 'plausible.'

Again, I know in this sub, the word genocide can feel like it shuts conversation down. I’m not here to accuse Israel personally, that’s for the courts to determine, but when the top academic association on genocide, the same field that studies Rwanda, Armenia, the Holocaust, and Bosnia, issues a resolution like this, to me that seems significant.

So I’m asking honestly, obviously expecting a variety of opinions, how should we interpret this? Does this indicate a genuine scholarly consensus that the world should take seriously? Or will people dismiss the IAGS itself as biased/antisemitic? If the latter, what does that say about how we engage with uncomfortable academic findings?

Imagine for a second Hamas does not exist (like in the West Bank) and the people are still facing cruel and unjust(Illegal) occupation and having their land usurped. Is there a model of violent resistance that would be considered moral and justified? 

I want you to really think about this. If you comment with something like ""well if they didn't rape people that would be nice"" That's just reading into the narrative of Hamas. I don't want to know what it should not be. I want to know what it should be from a Zionist opinion. 

Please note: 

*I will not respond to any comment that gives me ""well if only they didn't.."" or anyone who's denying that there is a brutal occupation currently happening in the West Bank*. 

Also if you're on the side of the illegal settlers please don't bother to provide an input. It would be irrelevant because you've already committed to being a validated aggressor.

Context and Question:
If you were a Palestinian citizen whose 10-year-old child was abducted by the IDF, who regularly faced reads from soldiers who locked them in a room of their house in the middle of the night, who experienced settler violence on a daily basis with the military occupier only there to guard the settlers who were illegally occupying your land. 

What would be your resistance? How would you defeat the occupation force from your land?

I want a detailed plan on what a moral Palestinian armed resistance would look like. That achieves two objectives. 1) returning the Palestinian hostages currently in Israeli prisons. 2) removing the occupation forces and the settlers from Palestinian lands based on the 1948 borders.

I’ve engaged in some very interesting conversations in this sub and came across an article online from a source that I’m unfamiliar with. The perspective from the Israeli side on this article was the most compelling that I’ve read so far and wanted to check and see how accurate it is. I appreciate your feedback.


“Israeli television news reports almost nothing of what is happening to civilians in Gaza; the only images they show are of ruined houses, earth churned up by armored personnel carriers and flattened landscapes. The images of overflowing emergency rooms with wounded children lying on the floor, of rescuers pulling people out of crushed buildings, of mass graves and the tent camp at Rafah, are entirely absent. This selective reporting is not new — I described the same phenomenon in a 2009 piece for the Columbia Journalism Review about the Israeli media’s coverage of Operation Cast Lead.
As I wrote then, and this remains true today, Israelis have always felt that they face constant existential threats from their neighbors and that a powerful military response is the only possible deterrent. They are still utterly traumatized by the attacks Hamas carried out on Oct. 7; it’s fair to say that, more than four months later, they are still living the events of that terrible day, which many — perhaps most — see as proof that peace with the Palestinians is impossible. In this atmosphere, there is no appetite for self-criticism or compassion for the other side, so television news is patriotic about the war, highlighting soldiers’ bravery and showing only scenes devoid of humans in Gaza; the destroyed buildings are described as Hamas hideouts or places where soldiers discovered weapons caches. This coverage reinforces the widespread conviction that “their” soldiers don’t deliberately harm civilians, that people die because Hamas uses them as human shields, and that the international media is axiomatically anti-Israel.
Most Israelis speak English well enough to follow the news about Gaza in the international media, but for the most part they choose to let their own media act as gatekeepers. In this role, a television news presenter will summarize an article or television report critical of Israel that was published in an international media outlet and hold it up as evidence that the world doesn’t care about Israel’s trauma, or doesn’t understand its need to reestablish security after the Hamas incursion of Oct. 7. Scrolling through Israeli social media makes clear that the vast majority of Israelis are either unaware of what Palestinians are enduring in Gaza, or simply do not believe the reports in the international media.”

1ad0pjo,2024-01-28,Palestine,"When it comes to Boycotts and Sanctions Pro Palestinians should know that there was one American President who implemented sanctions on Israel. Dwight Eisenhower. This history should be used as part of the arguments for BDS. When it comes to the colonisation of Palestine and the rights of Palestinian Arabs, Eisenhower is the last that would come to mind for many people. First, he's an American president and American presidents for obvious reasons Republican or Democrat have either ignored or have been complicit in the active suppression of Palestinian rights. Second, Eisenhower as a Cold Warrior was essentially the symbol of American and Western Imperialism. Eisenhower as a general helped build the N.A.T.O alliance. Eisenhower as President was the architect of many of the CIA coups in the Third World such as Iran, Guatelama, the Congo, and planning for the Bay of Pigs in Cuba. It was during the Eisenhower Presidency that the U.S used it's veto to defend the Apartheid regime in South Africa for Cold War purposes. So Eisenhower for Cold War purposes was not a friend of colonised people. 

And yet when it came to Israel-Palestine Eisenhower had a completely different approach. First, when it came to the U.N General Assembly and Security Council, unlike other administrations that vote against U.N resolutions condemning Israel, Eisenhower supported them. And when I say support, I don't simply mean ""abstain"" or even voting for the resolutions. Eisenhower ordered his diplomats to craft the U.N resolutions condemning Israel. When it came to sanctions itself Eisenhower implemented sanctions on Israel not just once, but at least 3-4 times. The first time came right when he assumed the presidency in 1953 when the Qibya massacre occurred. Eisenhower sanctioned Israel and then had the U.N Security Council adopt resolution 101 censuring Israel. Another and probably his most famous time is during the Suez Canal Crisis. Nasser in Egypt nationalised the Suez Canal and was also arming and funding the Palestinian Feyadeen. This leads Israel, Britain and France to launch a Tripartite invasion of both Gaza and Egypt(yes Israel also invaded Gaza in 56). In the process of Israel's invasion of Gaza Israeli forces committed the Khan Younis Massacre. The Western Alliance had hoped to have Eisenhower's backing but they were mistaken. Eisenhower during the Suez affair decided to sanction not just Israel but all three at once. His sanctions on the United Kingdom were apparently so severe it created the worst economic crisis the U.K had since the Great Depression. That forced them to withdraw and long term led to the collapse of the British Empire. 

What makes the Suez Affair in particular even more interesting is this. Suez occurred October 29-Nov 7 of 1956. That was right when the 1956 election in America was happening, literally when Americans were casting their ballots. Eisenhower explicitly chose to sanction not just Israel, but Israel, France and the U.K right when that was happening. In terms of the domestic politics of it he of course faced a tremendous amount of opposition. He was the Republican President of the 50s(which makes this interesting). The Democrats had a majority in the House and Senate. When Eisenhower sought sanctions on Israel he faced Congressional opposition from the Democrats who in the Senate was being led by Majority leader Lyndon Johnson. Lyndon Johnson would later become president after Kennedy's assassination and establish the ""Special"" relationship with Israel in 1965. Because of the opposition of Congress, Eisenhower bypassed Congress and imposed his own executive sanctions anyways. Britain and France withdrew in 56 but Israel remained in parts of Egypt and the Gaza Strip. Because of this Eisenhower threatened more sanctions, this time U.N sanctions and he went before the American public in a radio address to make his case using the presidential bully pulpit. He said the following things that was interesting: 

""The Government of Israel has not yet accepted, as adequate insurance of its own safety after withdrawal, the far-reaching United Nations Resolution of February 2 plus the important declaration of United States policy made by our Secretary of State on February 11. Israel seeks something more. It insists on firm guarantees as a condition to withdrawing its forces of invasion. **This raises a basic question of principle. Should a nation which attacks and occupies foreign territory in the face of United Nations disapproval be allowed to impose conditions on its own withdrawal?**......I would, I feel, be untrue to the standards of the high office to which you have chosen me, if I were to lend the influence of the United States to the proposition that a nation which invades another should be permitted to exact conditions for withdrawal....**We cannot consider that the armed invasion and occupation of another country are ""peaceful means"" or proper means to achieve justice and conformity with international law**.""\_President Eisenhower(Radio Address, February 20, 1957). 

Because of this, as well as the threat of U.N sanctions that Eisenhower was about to impose, Golda Meir as Israel's foreign minister was forced to announce in March of 1957 that Israel would pull out of Gaza, officially ending the Suez affair. What this historically example shows us this. We have confirmed historical data that sanctions work as a tool in terms of dealing with the Palestine issue and pursuing justice. As useful as the South Africa analogy is, and it should be used, we don't even need to go that far. We literally have the history of the Palestine conflict itself that shows us that B.D.S is the way to go. The second thing here is this. The president, if he or she wanted to, can use their bully pulpit to make the case for the Palestinians. The choice not to is exactly that. A choice. Yes, there are lobbies and political pressure, but as seen here a politician can choose to have some backbone and stand up for what is right. Every minute Biden fails to use his bully pulpit to advocate for the Palestinians, and to continue to arm Israel, and to actually cut of aid to Palestinian refugees, is an extra minute that he and politicians like him are complicit in the genocidal oppression of the Palestinian people.",anti,pro,

Ukraine and Belarus, as far as I’m aware, weren't states nor did they have kingdoms in their names, they were just regions in the Russian Empire, therefore Russia annexing Ukraine is ok. It’s a pretty dumb argument.",anti,pro,

18w3c8e,2024-01-01,IsraelPalestine,"Can We Please Have An Honest Conversation About Terrorism? Can We Please Have An Honest Conversation About Terrorism? I want to know what people honestly believe about the terrorism coming out of Palestinian territories. Especially The West Bank. Do people believe there is a terrorism problem in The West Bank? Are Palestinians collectively guilty of terrorism or is it just a select few? Is there data that supports your view either way? 

For the pro-Palestinians, what makes you so sure that the fault for the terrorism lies only at the feet of the terrorist who is successful in committing an attack? Is there any fault at all that is born by the ones who plotted unsuccessfully? Are people who are currently plotting terrorism that is yet to occur in any way responsible for terrorism? What about the people who support the known terrorists, their family, their wives, mothers, fathers, grandparents, don't they bear some of the responsibility? 

For those against the Palestinians, do you believe that all Palestinians are at fault because some of them commit acts of terror? Do you honestly believe that Muslims are a terrorist propagating religion, or is something else at play here? Is there space for the viewpoint that terrorism is the end result of oppression and that everyone, if extensively oppressed, would become a terrorist eventually? 

For those who are against Hamas only, but think Israel is overplaying their hand when it comes to Palestine, what are your thoughts? Many of the questions above are applicable to you too. Can't Israel have problematic policies and also be a victim at the same time? 

# I'll now share my personal thoughts:

I have always hated prejudice. I cannot stand for people who think all black people are less human because some black people engage in criminal behaviors, and drug profiteering, and/or gangsterism. That is disgusting, racial-profiling sophistry. Or those fools who think that Mexicans are animals and they need to build some xenophobic border wall to stop them from coming over and stealing American jobs, and raping women. It's a pitiful racist xenophobic cesspool in America right now because of prejudicial people. We are all human beings, and we should only be judged by our actions, and never by some physical characteristic that we have no control over. Nor judged because of reasonable cultural differences that we shouldn't be required to control at all. 

But I am not generally an absolutist, and I would never declare it is impossible for a group of people with strong ties to be collectively guilty. In fact I think that viewpoint would ignore reality. We are all collectively guilty of some things, for instance, there isn't a person on this planet who hasn't gotten a short term gain at the earth's expense over the long term. We all benefit from international trade that uses petro-carbons, We all use plastic, and silicon, and metals, we all breathe out carbon dioxide which is a greenhouse gas. Climate change is a problem we have all contributed to in some way.

But there are less philosophical ways for groups to be collectively guilty: Gangs are collectively guilty, as well as violent motorcycle clubs. Sport and school clubs can be collectively guilty of hazing. Cults. Police precincts that have rampant police misconduct that goes unreported are collectively guilty. Large criminal conspiracies. Price-fixing corporate boards are collectively guilty. It goes on. In these cases all of the members know what is going on, most of them support it, some of them commit bad acts, a few of them command and control the bad behavior. Some bear more responsibility but none are innocent. 

My point is, the Palestinians in The West Bank could be collectively guilty of terrorism. It is possible. And there are reasons to believe this is true. First of all, we need to look at the extent of terrorism in The West Bank: does the level of terrorism suggest widespread community support or not? 

Here's [a comment I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/18q8vo6/comment/kf03ucu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) earlier that expands on this thought (references are linked in the original): 

*Do you want to know how different a fringe terrorism problem is from the Palestinian terrorism problem? Just look at United States:*  
 *""From fiscal years 2013 through 2021, the FBI's number of open domestic terrorism-related cases grew by 357 percent from 1,981 to 9,049, From calendar year 2010 to 2021, I&amp;A tracked a total of 231 domestic terrorism incidents, with racially- or ethnically-motivated violent extremists committing the most violent incidents during the time period."" - U.S. Government Accountability Office*  
*Meaning about 10,000 terrorism plans resulted in 231 incidents that were actually carried out over a ten year period in the United States, a country of over 320,000,000 people. That works out to less than 2 terrorist attacks per month. This is a fringe problem.*  
*Now let's look at Palestine: Since March of 2022, there have been 3371 ground-based terrorist attacks by Palestinians, as well as over 10,000 Rocket attacks. 13371 terrorist attacks over 22 months by a nation with a population of less than 5,000,000.*  
*In summary, even though Palestine has a population of about One Sixty-Fourth the size of the United States, the Palestinians still manage 300 times the number of domestic terrorist attacks that the US population can muster. That's a 1,919,900% difference. That is not a fringe problem.*  
*Palestinian terrorism is an intrinsic pervasive attitude problem throughout Palestinian society. There is no way this level of violence could possibly be attained and sustained without widespread support from the vast majority of Palestinians. It is a problem of hatred and racism, and intolerance, that they preferentially perpetrate against the innocent Israelis rather than the ones directly connected to their poor circumstances.*  
*You can give me excuses about how there are reasons to be hateful, but that doesn't change anything. There are plenty of reasons that Americans have for hatred: Racism, Dems vs. Republicans, Christian Right vs. LGBTQ, Rich vs. Poor. Police vs Ethnic Populations, Women's issues, Abortion, Environmentalism, and yet their society as a whole doesn't foster terrorism.*

If 9,000+ known cases of terrorist plots resulted in 231 terrorist attacks in United States, how many known and unknown terrorist plots would have to be going on in Palestinian territories to produce 6885 yearly attacks? (9049 / 231 x 6685 = 261,872) 

If the ratios are correct, then it took about 260,000 estimated terrorist plots to produce 6885 annual terrorist attacks in Palestine. And that's only by using a ratio based on the known terrorist plots in America. Adding in the unknown plots would likely produce a much higher ratio. Then you have to consider that the vast majority of these attacks would have been carried out by able bodied men. The population of able bodied men in Palestine would be a fraction of the men in Palestine. There's an estimated 1,100,000 able bodied men in Palestine based on a cursory glance of demographics data. 

with 260,000 annual plots, among 1.1M men, that would mean that almost 1 in 4 Palestinian men are currently plotting a terrorist attack, likely involving at least one other man. Then there's the women who are married to these thugs, knowingly supporting their schemes. The Parents too.

Given these estimates, my question is: ***Is it really reasonable to think that Palestinians are not as collectively guilty of terrorism as the Hell's Angels?***",pro,anti,

1ec8j7m,2024-07-25,IsraelPalestine,"Would the creation of a Jewish state only be possible with the expulsion of Arabs from their lands? I believe in the existence of the Jewish state. I have researched its formation, and it started with legal purchases of land (for a fair amount) from the government and mostly from absentee landowners, which, in my view, is perfectly legitimate. Moreover, the Jews entered the land in the late 19th century when it was lowly populated and most of it was uninhabitable, and they made significant contributions to the land that made it more inhabitable, which assisted with the rapid population growth of Arabs. When you consider this with the fact that in the 20th century, Jews were being persecuted and wanted to have peace and security, it sounds more than fair for them to come and purchase land.

However, the problem - which I am unsure what the answer is - isn't Jews entering the land. It's about the formation of a Jewish state. Would it be possible to form a Jewish state without expelling Arabs from their houses? I'm curious to know what percentage of the land was promised to the Jews in the Balfour Declaration? I read around 1920 that Jews already obtained 2.5% of the entire area. Second, if you look at the 1938 Peel Commission, Arabs were promised 80% of the land; however, despite the large amount of land promised, there would still have to be land transfers for that to be possible. To counter my own point, when Israel accepted the 1948 UN Partition Plan, 40% of their own population were to be Arab, which indicates that they would happy to live with Arabs, as long as Jews were still the majority. But, this was already after people would've been expelled from their lands due to conflict so would the UN Partition Plan only be possible because Arabs were already expelled from their homes prior?",pro,neutral,

1j1ex10,2025-03-02,IsraelPalestine,"Who will win the battle between Israeli tank and Palestinian memory? Came across this op-ed by in ""The Gulf News"" by a ""*noted academic, journalist and author""* who apparently grew up in a Palestinian refugee camp. The entire piece accuses Israel of colonialism and hate for the Palestinians. The message is clear. The Zionists had it in for the Palestinians from day one. 

Now I don't dispute the facts. During the 1947-48 war hundreds of thousands of Palestinians were displaced from areas that today are now Israel. And Israel has done some pretty nasty stuff since then, especially in the west bank where Jewish terrorism is now a fact , as is IDF complicity. IMO, Israel's current government is the worst in its history. Not only are they directly responsible for the sorry state of the IDF on 7/10/23 and for the clusterfuck that followed whereby all civil systems broke down completely, they've also turned this war into journey of revenge which in many ways mirrors what Hamas has been doing since the 70's.

That all said, this piece by the Palestinian *academic, journalist and author* is a prime example of what the Palestinians refuse to admit, even to themselves, let alone the millions of ignorant idiots who mindlessly chant ""from the river to the sea"" on university campuses and in demonstrations. The native Arabs of pre-1948 Palestine, collectively known as ""Palestinians"" since the 60's when Egypt born Arafat coined that term are partially responsible or every calamity that has befallen them since 1948, and particularly for the complete and utter destruction of Gaza since 7/10/23.

They rejected the UN partition plan of 1947, they rejected a generous offer from Barak in the early 2000's and they knowingly and intentionally undermined Perez's campaign in 1996 following Rabin's murder with a terrorist wave which Netanyahu rode all the way to the PMship. But they've also perpetuated their own situation by turning refugee camps into a cornerstone of their identity where terror, violence, corruption and destitution have become a way of life. The Palestinians are not the first nor the last people in history to get displaced. It happened to 10's of millions of Europeans after WW2. It also happened to over a million Jews after WW2 when they lost their homes and possessions, not only in Europe but also in the Arab world which entire Jewish communities had to flee with nothing. These displaced people managed to redefine themselves, pick up the pieces and build lives from themselves. The Palestinians, on the other hand, built an entire society and social structure focussing only on their refugee status while harboring a dream to annihilate Israel and reclaim the land they consider theirs. The purpose of UNRWA, an organization dedicated to ""help"" Palestinian refugees, was not to help repatriate them. It made sure they stayed where they were in incubators that fostered a mentality of hate, lack of hope. The Palestinians were never able to build meaningful national or social institutions, only oppressive, corrupt and religious systems that favored small clans and threw the rest of the people to the dogs. 

The Palestinians blame Israel for their displacement and their horrible history since 1948. To be fair, Israel did contribute ""generously"" to that but it was and still is the Palestinians that are their own worst enemy. They, along with a millions of clueless ""supporters"" in the west celebrated the success of Hamas on 7/10/23, the successful raid into Israel, the ""heroic"" murder of over 1200 Israelis.

I say to this Palestinian academic who glorifies the Palestinian refugee ethos, I hope that the memory survives long after the last tank leaves Gaza. I hope that the Palestinians remember for decades the consequence of launching a senseless, murderous attack on Israel and celebrating killing women, children, seniors and party goers. That memory should be etched into their collective memory. I hope it becomes a part of the refugee ethos just like I hope it will be etched into Hezbollah supporters in Lebanon. I don't celebrate the deaths of innocent Palestinians in Gaza. But this author who attributes the destruction of refugee camps in northern Gaza ignores the fact that those refugee camps are were the launching pad for 7/10. It's where the terrorists took the hostages. It's where Hamas dug tunnels, launched rockets and amassed weapons in schools hospitals, and refugee aid centers. I hope they remember because maybe they will finally understand that they cannot murder Israel out of existence and that trying to do so can and will cost them what little they may have left.

You want to glorify the refugee camps culture of hate and violence and dreams of annihilating Israel instead of striving to rebuild and thrive, that's your prerogative. But I truly hope you never forget that this idiotic glorification is what got the Palestinians to where they are now, living hungry and cold in tents.

An investigation revealed that Israeli soldiers from the Nahal Brigade used an 80-year-old Palestinian man as a human shield in Gaza City. They tied an explosive command wire around his neck and forced him to check houses for booby traps. After eight hours, he and his wife were told to evacuate to a “safe zone,” but due to a lack of coordination, another IDF unit shot and killed them.

Source: https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-02-16/ty-article/idf-reportedly-used-elderly-gazan-as-human-shield-tied-explosive-around-his-neck/00000195-0e56-d1b4-a7fd-cf7742bf0000 

The incident highlights contradictions in Israel’s claims about human shields. While Israel accuses Hamas of using civilians to protect fighters, the IDF itself has used vulnerable Palestinians to shield its troops. The failure to protect evacuees, the disregard for Palestinian lives, and the lack of accountability suggest systemic issues within the IDF.

Investigations by groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have found no conclusive evidence that Hamas deliberately forces civilians to act as human shields. While Hamas operates in civilian areas, this does not legally constitute human shielding. Meanwhile, Israel’s actions raise serious ethical and legal concerns, as they mirror the very tactics they condemn.

Edit:

To people who think this is a one case thing or it's not a common practice by IDF

The use of Palestinians as human shields by Israeli Defense Forces has been documented by human rights organizations including Human Rights Watch, B'Tselem and Amnesty International

There are prooves of women who crossed the fence where it had been demolished with auit acses full of clothes because they had been told that they could move into the now emptied houses of the kibbutzim.

They said, as they learned from their news outlets, that she’s an innocent woman who was driving her car, when suddenly a gas tank she was carrying while moving between houses caught fire (out if nowhere 🤷🏻‍♀️) and an IDF soldier saw that, thought it was a bombing attempt, shot at her causing her to lose control of the car then resulted in an explosion, where she got severely injured, and he got mildly hurt too. 
Apparently it was an accident. She’s a mother and she had her masters thesis discussion the next day, which wouldn’t make sense that she’d attempt an attack. (Info I gathered from Aran news outlets)

Wikipedia says it was an attempted attack. And the IDF soldier testified that she was driving straight towards him and she yelled “ allahu akbar “ before the explosion.

I know this is pretty controversial and a lot of people including people who lean more pro-Israel may disagree.

1. 80-95 percent of Jews are Zionists so are you saying you only hate 80-95 percent of all Jews and are okay with the other 20-5 percent? 

2. Zionism is defined as- supporting the development and continuation of a Jewish nation (in this case yes Israel since it’s the only Jewish nation) how is this wrong? Imagine there was a word for saying you are for the development and continuation of a Muslim nation let’s just use the word “Islamnationism” now imagine a group emerged called “anti-islamnationists” this would be problematic and most people would consider that group Islamophobic. So why is this not the case when it comes to being anti-Zionist? At this point it’s clear anti-Zionism is a front for anti-semitism. Anti-Zionists as a group may not hold antisemitic views but that doesn’t mean being an anti-Zionist isn’t inherently antisemitic. 

3. You cannot change definitions to fit your narrative. Zionism has a definition and most people who consider themselves Zionists base that belief off of the definition and not the one you have personally given to the word. 

4. I guess my point is while not all anti-Zionists are antisemitic anti-Zionism as a whole is inherently antisemitic since you are basically saying you don’t support the existence of a Jewish nation which would be frowned upon when talking about any other religious group so therefore should be discouraged. Instead of labeling yourself an anti-Zionist maybe consider using anti-Israel although I would disagree with you I wouldn’t consider that belief inherently antisemitic just flawed logically.",pro,anti,

It seems like the indigenous connection of every other group in North America is revered, but the Jewish indigenous connection to Israel is not even acknowledged by many. The same people who insist it is important to recognize Canadians and Americans are living on indigenous territory refuse to acknowledge that Israel is perhaps the only successful example of decolonization in human history. It is the only time an indigenous group has revived its language and returned to its ancestral homeland after being colonized and forced to leave for centuries. The Jews have lived in Israel for thousands of years and there has been a consistent presence of Jews in Israel there even after the majority were forced to leave. Early Zionists invested money and time to transform swamps and deserts in what was called Palestine at the time into a thriving nation. The standard of living increased significantly in the region after they arrived. Israel is obviously not perfect but it should be celebrated by people who support indigenous rights as a success story and perhaps something to emulate (in a peaceful way). 

Many other indigenous groups in the Middle East, such as the Kurds and Assyrians, are the victim of Arab colonialism and conquest. They  should also have the right to achieve self determination in non violent way. The idea that only Europeans are guilty of colonialism is completely ahistorical.

1g6h0c5,2024-10-18,IsraelPalestine,"Debunking the “Three Oaths” Argument Against Israel There are many anti-Israel voices that use the “Three Oaths” mentioned in the Talmud as a reason why Jews supposedly shouldn’t be in Israel today. They argue that Jews are betraying these oaths and that Israel shouldn’t exist because of them. But this argument is misleading and ignores the actual context of Jewish history and the creation of the State of Israel.

First, let me explain what the “Three Oaths” are. According to the Talmud, after the destruction of the Second Temple and the beginning of exile, the Jewish people were bound by three oaths:

	1.	Jews should not “ascend [to the Land of Israel] as a wall,” meaning by force.
	2.	Jews should not rebel against the nations.
	3.	The nations should not oppress Israel too much.

Some anti-Israel individuals claim that by re-establishing the State of Israel, Jews are violating these oaths, particularly the first one about not returning to the land by force. However, this interpretation is not accurate for a few key reasons:

	1.	The Return to Israel Was Not by Force: The modern return to Israel happened gradually, through immigration and political negotiations—not through military conquest. The Jewish population increased over time, and the United Nations presented a plan in 1947 that offered both Jews and Palestinians a state. Despite the UN offering Jews a smaller portion of land, we accepted the plan in good faith, while many Arab states rejected it. The creation of Israel was endorsed by international law, not by force.
	2.	We Fought in Defense, Not Conquest: After the UN proposed the partition plan, it was the surrounding Arab nations who attacked Israel, leading to the 1948 War of Independence. Israel had to defend itself, and through that defense, we maintained our state. It wasn’t that we went to war to conquer the land—it was about survival and self-defense.
	3.	The Context of the Oaths: Many Jewish scholars argue that the Three Oaths were specific to the time of exile and were never meant to be binding forever. Additionally, the third oath is often overlooked: the nations should not oppress Israel excessively. Given the atrocities of the Holocaust, it’s hard to argue that the world upheld this part of the oaths, which further undermines the argument.

The modern State of Israel came into existence through legal international agreements, not by breaking the Three Oaths. The claim that Israel’s existence violates Jewish law is a distortion of history and Jewish teachings. The truth is, Israel was established through diplomacy, and the wars we fought were to defend ourselves, not to take land by force.",pro,neutral,

1d42wu4,2024-05-30,IsraelPalestine,"Netanyahu has played Israel as a Fiddle One of my first posts, scratch that my first post on this subreddit was that Israel does have the right to defend itself from the attacks on Oct 7 but that the person in Charge Benjamin Netanyahu having a considerable amount of sway be involved whose prerogative benefits an extension of the war instead of its ends was quite simple an insance choice. Any attack on Gaza, every hostage deal denial would all be colored not with the fact Israel is trying to wage a war of their protection, but a war to ensure Netanyahu and his political party would not be forced to get voted out.

We've seen Israel diverge a lot in this war, compared to others. Israel has always accepted hostage swaps for two very simple reasons, one is that they usually assassinate these people in the future, they are globally known for their assassination whether its Hamas or Iran and second they would just gather more hostages. We actually saw this during this war after the first hostage swap, they went to the streets and just grabbed more prisoners. All of a sudden Israel wants no Hostage swap, Israel wants to conduct a war to end Hamas, something that all Military commanders say is an impossible task, we've seen the Israel party members say this war won't end until Hamas, and you people swallowed it, in a blind rage fit of anger not realizing it was said for the Likud party self-interest. You literally chose the party that allowed Oct 7 to happen, the leader that made Sure Hamas got its money from Qatar over your hostages and still to do. You allowed a party that specifically bombed an Iranian Consulate to ensure they would respond and endanger the lives of Israeli citizens as it would be a great PR move for them. It was insane to have a person/party that a delay to the war benefits them be involved in the war process, but that is exactly what happened.

People on this Subreddit say Hamas is bad, and Benjamin Netanyahu is bad but don't worry at least for Netanyahu he will get voted out. and you know you were kind of right by January only 15 percent of people would want him to stay. but then guess what happened that war never ended and what happened with the delay, a poll month ago showed that Netanyahu was only 5 Percent behind Gantz if there was a reelection. A huge improvement, come to a poll that was run this week and what do we have. We have Netanyahu finally leading if there is a re-election today. All the unnecessary death in Gaza, all the hostages not swapped , this in my opinion is exactly what Netanyahu wanted against the self-interest of Israel wanting to save its hostages. End of the day he is one of the biggest winners in this war and he played Israel as a fiddle to achieve what he wanted.

1kwx5j3,2025-05-27,IsraelPalestine,"A Constructive middle-ground conversation that broke out on the Julian Dorey podcast two months ago. For my purposes today, please ignore the title and the first few minutes of the podcast about the Mossad, it is a red herring and not my point in posting.  The relevant conversation about Israel/Palestine is from 3:45 to about 10:00.

The podcast guest is a former CIA agent.

The reason that I am posting this brief clip is that I long to hear more of these conversations, and I think it will help others to see that such conversations are possible.  

The clip contains a discussion that broke out between two relatively reasonable-seeming people regarding:

- the humanitarian disaster
- Kamala Harris's position on Israel argued to cost her the presidency.
- The Podcaster says he ""comes down the middle"" on the issues, but both men discuss the significant difficulties in the US of having *any* conversation.
- criticism of Netanyahu claimed by the guest to result in branding as anti-semitic.
- over-generalizing, but criticism of anything Israeli leaves you branded as anti-semitic.
- The Podcaster makes some interesting remarks about why he is ok to have the discussion then, but not a year prior, in terms of the pushback he would get.
- in the future he looks to work on a podcast with a pro-Israel guest, and an anti-Israel guest, and then he would like to find nuance in it, and push back on both of them.
- some other points made about the importance of coming to negotiations.

Where I am coming from on this is not to try to agree or disagree with everything, but I think there are a large number of people out here who, to one degree or another, have complicated nuanced views that may at times be perceived as falling in the middle somewhere, and who may long to engage in these sorts of conversations, or hear them carried out by others on youtube and elsewhere.

However, journalists are only every allowed in front line battle zones with the military. This is still not good enough for the Pro-Pali side. 

There are like a 1000 independent journalists reporting from Gaza every day. There is internet and they broadcast hundreds of videos, images and reports each day. This is still not good enough for the Pro-Pali side. 

Today, Israel hits a observation post cameraman in a hospital. Pro-Pali are going nutso. They are accusing Israel of targeting a journalist in a strike against a hospital. ""Super Double Genocide!!!!"" 

They ignore that the cameraman is a surveillance operative using the camera to plot to kill IDF. This is a valid military target. It is usually the first thing that any battlefield officer will attack. 

It is a war crime? Yes, it is a war crime to operate a military unit from a hospital. The consequences of the crime, is that the hospital is not protected from attack. 

Hamas does this all the time. They have been doing for over a decade. Hamas knows that if discovered, this observation post will be eliminated. They put the bullseye there intentionally. 

No. He was not a journalist. He was there for an extended period of time, the camera was concealed with a towel and he believed he was slick and operating undetected. 

Why? Did the terrorist think that he would be safe in the hospital? NO! It's a super double bonus for Hamas, they accused Israel of striking a ""Journalist"", accuse Israel of striking a hospital and these accusations get spread by 200 Million useful idiots that are more than happy to spread anti-Israel vitriol. 

The best part for Hamas, they cause the deaths of another 20 Gazans. That is their goal, Martyrdom to annihilate Israel with bad publicity garnered by pictures of dead Gazans. (Who woulda thunk a war by updoots?)

The Double Tap. This part is tricky. There were 2 strikes within minutes of each other. I'm not a military expert but it seems to me that timing a missile and a drone within a couple of minutes is normal. Like this isn't a video game, there's like thousands of pounds of hardware that has to get there. 

Being a journalist is a dangerous job. Israel did not target any journalists in this strike. The published their target, observation post and attacked it. Then 4 journalists rushed to the scene with their cameras to get footage. This is the goal of war time journalists, to capture battle in the moment. However, in this case, they were too quick. The rush to the target before the strike had ended.

This is why war journalism is dangerous. IDF did not target the journalists. The journalists rushed to the target of the strike to get vids and got killed. 

It is an impossible situation. Hamas is still actively at war, attacking Israelis and holding hostages. IDF must defend this war and neutralize the threat. Hamas has created a system that any attack against its hostilities, in this case an observation post, cannot be achieve without killing civilians. 

Unfortunately for the truth, 200 million useful idiots will make today be ""Attacked Hospital"" ""Killed Journalists"" and IDF is not responsible for either of these tragic outcomes. It was the same with the Al-Ahli and European Hospitals.",pro,anti,

Lets have a look just in the history of this solution, trying to not being puzzled by anything else. 

First time we hear about separate Jewish and Arab(not Palestinian) at the land of Palestine in [UN resolution 181](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-185393/) in 1947. This resolution described the boundaries of two states and status of Jerusalem. Jewish congress accepted and established Israel state in the borders described by UN resolution. All Arab states voted against resolution and immediately attacked newly born Israel. 

In May 1948 UN set up a [Mediator for Palestine](https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/gres186.asp). It's worth to note that his recommendation was to revise boundaries of Jewish and Arab state to make it ""more equitable, workable and consistent with existing realities in Palestine"" and ""in view of the historical connection and common interests of Transjordan and Palestine, there would be compelling reasons for merging the Arab territory of Palestine with the territory of Transjordan, subject to such frontier rectifications regarding other Arab States as may be found practicable and desirable.""
He also claimed that ""The Arab inhabitants of Palestine are not citizens or subjects of Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Transjordan, the States which are at present providing them with a refuge and the basic necessities of life. As residents of Palestine, a former mandated territory for which the international community has a continuing responsibility until a final settlement is achieved, these Arab refugees understandably look to the United Nations for effective assistance."" stating refugees had to have ultimate right to return to their homes in current Jewish state or being paid a compensation for loss of their property.  

On the territory which latter became Israel about 1.2 mln Arabs lived in 1947, about 80k lived in Gaza and 400K in West Bank region. After establishing of Israel 700K Arabs fled from Israel to Gaza (360K in 1948), West Bank and other countries. 500K Arabs remained to live in Israel. 

In December 1948 UN established Conciliation commission by [resolution 194](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-177019/). There is no words about two states in this resolution anymore, but only the right of refugees to return or to get a compensation as well as ""Instructs the Conciliation Commission to seek arrangements among the Governments and authorities concerned which will facilitate the economic development of the area, including arrangements for access to ports and airfields and the use of transportation and communication facilities;"" (to continue) (1/3)",pro,anti,
1n0sv9b,2025-08-26,IsraelPalestine,"Israel, the Petrodollar, and why Palestine is caught in the middle Israel doesn’t isn't just allies for “shared values” with the U.S. or whatever—it’s there as the regional guard dog for the petrodollar system. That system is what keeps the U.S. dollar king of the global economy.

Quick context on the petrodollar:
Back in the 70s, the U.S. cut deals with Saudi Arabia so oil would only be sold in dollars. That forced every country to stockpile USD, giving America crazy leverage. The thing is, anytime a leader tries to challenge this setup, it usually ends badly for them.

– Iraq (Saddam Hussein): In 2000, Saddam started selling oil in euros instead of dollars. By 2003, the U.S. had invaded under the banner of “weapons of mass destruction.” We all know how that turned out.
– Libya (Muammar Gaddafi): Gaddafi pushed for a gold-backed African currency that would compete with the petrodollar. In 2011, NATO stepped in, and Gaddafi ended up dead in the streets.
– Venezuela (Hugo Chávez &amp; Maduro): Venezuela tried to ditch the dollar for oil sales and push back against U.S. sanctions. Cue years of economic warfare, sanctions, and attempted regime change.

Now compare that with Israel: instead of challenging the dollar, Israel reinforces U.S. dominance in the region. It’s rewarded with billions in military aid, political cover, and carte blanche to act against Palestinians.

Counterarguments I always hear:

“This is just conspiracy talk, the Iraq war was about WMDs, Libya was about human rights, etc.”
Yeah, that’s the official line. But funny how the leaders who got targeted were the same ones pushing alternatives to the dollar.

“The dollar isn’t that tied to oil anymore.”
True, global finance has shifted, but oil is still the biggest commodity traded in USD. Until that changes, the petrodollar remains a pillar of U.S. hegemony.

“Israel’s about democracy, not petrodollars.”
If it was about democracy, the U.S. wouldn’t back Saudi Arabia. Enough said.

Palestine isn’t just fighting occupation—they’re caught at the crossroads of an empire propped up by fossil fuels and the dollar. Israel is basically the “unsinkable aircraft carrier” in the Middle East, making sure no regional power can do what Saddam, Gaddafi, or Venezuela tried to do.

That’s why the U.S. doesn’t just “support” Israel—it needs Israel. And until that system is cracked, Palestinians will keep paying the price.

TL;DR: Leaders who challenged the petrodollar (Saddam, Gaddafi, Chávez/Maduro) were destroyed. Israel, on the other hand, reinforces it—so it gets endless support. Palestine is stuck in the middle of that power game.",anti,pro,

https://www.reddit.com/r/PigulNews/comments/1lop9jm/zohran_mamdani/

in case you can't see:

here's a quick summary of that confrontation:

During a campaign event in June 2025, Zohran Mamdani, a progressive New York State Assemblymember running for mayor, was challenged by a pro-Palestinian activist regarding his comments on Israel’s right to exist.

- The activist confronted Mamdani over his statement that “Israel has the right to exist,” which he had made during a recent debate.
- The activist interrupted and stated forcefully, _“It does not have the right to exist. It’s not your land to say that Israel has the right to exist,”_ before walking away mid-event.

- Mamdani has been vocal in support of Palestinian rights and backs the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.
- His position—that Israel should exist as a state with equal rights for all people, but not necessarily as a Jewish state—has drawn criticism from multiple sides, including progressive activists who say his stance still legitimizes a colonial structure, and pro-Israel advocates who say he undermines Israel’s legitimacy.

it was bound to happen, same thing happens with every pro Palestinian politician in america unless they are completely against israel even existing.

but the real importent lesson from that is the demands of the Palestinians themselves which is reflected here and in their actions throughout history:

they are are completely against israel even existing, so if israel wants peace, how can they even negotiate? it's really absurd that Israel even attempted negotiations for decades until the right wing leadership finally rose(netanyahu is the best example)

that's why i think the approach changed from trying to negotiate with people who don't want to negotiate to making negotiation become the Palestinian's best choice.

they can always choose to continue their ""resistance"" of trying to conquer israel but netanyahu understands that there needs to be consequences for such ""resistance"", gaza is an example of that.

as for the constant terrorist attacks and trying to undermine Israel's legitimacy on the global and political stage, it also needs to be addressed.

i think the expansion of settlements in area C in the west bank is not just to ""gain territory"", it's a path to peace, it's the ""ticking clock"" of Palestine's will to keep the approach of ""resistance"".

the more time passes, the more potential territory they lose, if they make a peace deal now it won't be any worse

and it's worth remembering that in the end it's just territory, it's not irreversible, israel has already removed their own settlements plenty of times for ""peace"", gaza, west bank, sinai...

only in the sinai example it was actually for peace, in the Palestine examples it was completely in vain, peace and recognition wasn't on the table, hamas was immediately elected in gaza and forced us to take extreme measure that till this day they cry about without mentioning the context.

our mistake was being too lenient on hamas without realizing they are a different entity from the PA with an even more extreme and suicidal principals, the ""ticking clock"" strategy only caused them to act more instead of negotiating",pro,anti,

No, Jews did not just show up in Israel in 1948. No, Israel was not a gift given to the Jews by colonial powers. No, Israel did not arise because of the Holocaust or in response to the Holocaust. No, the UN did not create the modern state of Israel.

The modern state of Israel was built and created SOLELY BY JEWS, over a period of almost 100 years, using Jewish capital , Jewish ingenuity, Jewish diplomatic efforts  and  Jewish military power. 
Jews have lived in the Land of Israel , almost continuously, for 3,000 years. In  the years immediately preceding the approval of the  Mandate of Palestine by the League of Nations , over 100,000 Jews lived in the Land of Israel.
Rishon Le-Zion, Zichron Ya'akov, Petach Tikvah and Rosh Pina were established prior to 1904
Agricultural schools were also established  around this time  and some of the students of these institutions went on to found kvutzot , the first of which was established at Degania on the Sea of Galilee in 1909.
Tel Aviv was founded in 1909.
Technion – Israel Institute of Technology ,Israel’s first university, was founded in 1912, 36 years before Israel’s Declaration of Independence. The Technion is credited with conceiving, founding and shaping the high-tech nation of the modern State of Israel.
The Hebrew University was founded in Jerusalem in 1918.
The principle of Jewish self-help was extended to the area of defense with the creation of ""HaShomer"", the Watchman, an association of Jewish guards set up in 1909 to defend Jewish settlements.
Ten years later,  the Histadrut became a powerful and unique institution. Not only did it serve as a trade union, defending the interests of the workers in Mandatory Palestine, but it was also constituted as ""Hevrat haOvdim"" (The Workers' Company), a holding company that owned several large corporations. Thus the Histadrut represented labor while it was in effect one of the largest employers in the Yishuv. The Histadrut also ran the largest ""Kupat Cholim"" (Sick Fund) as well as a vocational school system (Amal), daily newspaper (Davar), publishing company (Am Oved), sports club (HaPoel) and youth movement (HaNoar HaOved), to name only a few of the Histadrut's many activities.
In the same period,  elections were held for the ""Asefat Nivcharim"", the National Assembly of the Jews of Mandatory Palestine. The assembly elected a 36 member executive body known as the ""Va'ad Leumi"" (National Council), which represented the interests of Palestinian Jewry to the British authorities.

By 1939, before one-third of world Jewry was destroyed in the Holocaust, a geographic and demographic nucleus for a Jewish state was present in Mandatory  Palestine. By that date, more than 500,000 Jews and almost 75%  of all the land Jews would purchase by 1948 were already in Jewish hands.

The Jews had built their  state and created all the civic organizations necessary to run their state well before WW2. Again, by 1939 the modern state of Israel existed in all respects but for independence.",pro,anti,

During WW2 the Palestinian delegation to the British Army was almost entirely Jewish, we are talking thousands of soldiers who were considered to be Palestinian that were JEWISH. 

In fact one of the early Palestinian flags during the early century had a Jewish star on it, the current Palestinian flag was adopted in the 60s.

If you go to any city in the west bank and talk to the locals you will notice that many of the surnames have a meaning to describe the family origin for example AL-BAGHDADI are from Iraq and AL-MASRI are from Egypt, and those familiar with the families can actually tell you where the grandparents or great great grandparents arrived from. 

Those that were caught up in the war in 1948 and became refugees are no different in terms of losing their “land” from the Jews from Iraq who were expelled with all their assets taken away or Jews from Europe who lost homes during WW2.

Palestinians are the only people who stayed in refugee status for multiple generations, and one must ask the question why that is. 

Jews purchased lands, established a state, built the only functioning democracy in the Middle East, and are here to stay. 

Palestinians seem to be a massive NGO / political pawn, who only focus on their hate towards Jews and Israelis, while Israelis are working towards bettering their future and the future of their children, in my opinion if a Palestinian state is formed it won’t last, we all saw what happened in Gaza with the civil war between Hamas and Fatah as soon as Israel withdrew.

Starting with the 1950 Joint Defence Pact, to the United Arab Command in the 1960s, to the GCC’s Peninsula Shield in the 1980s, to Egypt’s 2015 proposal, and even Trump’s idea of a Middle East Security Alliance in 2017 — each time it’s either collapsed, stalled, or never got off the ground.

Meanwhile, NATO became the most successful alliance in history, partly because it’s not just military, but also economic and industrial. Defense spending stays within the alliance, supporting domestic industries and creating interdependence. By contrast, Arab states remain heavily dependent on outside suppliers (US, UK, France, Russia, China), with very little domestic defense industry integration.

1f7uk7f,2024-09-03,IsraelPalestine,"Should America Distance itself from Israel politically? This question is a genuine attempt at a discussion and I personally can’t decide on the best choice. Hear me out. Personally, I sympathize with both Palestinians and Israelis. I think both have legitimate plight and complaints against the opposing side. I think there should be a ceasefire NOW. I think Netanyahu, Smoltrich, and Ben-Givr are far-right criminals who belong in jail. I think Hamas are irredeemable terrorists whose upper leadership should be hunted down and imprisoned or killed for as long as it takes. But both sides are deeply dug in and hard headed. Naturally, both sides are interested in their own interests and that of their people.

This leads me to the topic of our discussion, as an American, as an agnostic, I’m not sure it’s in America’s interest to continue to get involved with the middle-east and staunchly back Israel. I think one can make a good argument that most of America’s issues in that region stem from our historic and staunch backing of Israel regardless how reckless it behaves. I also believe Israel is now a very rich and powerful country able to stand on its own even if it is outnumbered. 

I’m torn as a tax paying American with no direct link to Israel by heritage or religion. On one hand, I appreciate it is a country of fellow westerners (ideologically) and they are the only genuine democracy in the region. Therefore, we should help them. On the other hand, our support for Israel is the cause of a lot of our geopolitical headaches and I’m not sure what in hard tangible benefits America gets in return? 

Should America continue defending, at substantial cost, an island of western democracy? Or should America, cut off our close ties, stop blocking every UN resolution, stop giving an annual military stipend  and turn its focus to Asia and out of the Middle East? I don’t have any ill motivation against Israel or Palestine. Frankly, if I had to decide, I’d likely throw in with Israel. But I have confidence in their ability as a strong nuclear power to handle their own business. On the cynical side, Israel and Palestine can fight each other for as long as they want and it’s no longer America’s headache. A bonus for America since it’s obviously biased toward Israel, is that Israel will likely be able to continue to dominate the region but we no longer have will have to listen to Hamasniks whine to American leaders anymore. Our hands will be finally clean and technically impartial geopolitically.

#STEYR AUG!

This weapon barely needs and introduction, it’s a simple bullpup rifle that hails from Austria, and has become a major weapon of the Australian, Irish, New Zealand, and Austrian armed forces. This rifle is also one of the oldest continuously serving, and has managed to become easy to modify and upgrade as well. It is definitely a rifle worth praising as many militaries have used this gun.

On an unrelated note for the future:

I plan on doing the AK’s, but I am going to gradually do it and make a mega appreciation post for it so that way, you have the most notable variants, along with their quirks and features. And yes, that will include the Galil and Valmet rifles. I might not get all of the AK’s in, but I will get the noteworthy ones in there, don’t worry folks!

I’m an Israeli Jew, and I’ve been feeling a real pull lately to get to know Palestinian culture. I’ve always been into food, art, design, music, and languages, and the more I come across Palestinian culture, the more interested I am.

I also want to be honest: I feel really sorry about the recent violence and the racist anti-Arab attitudes I see around me in Israel. It’s frustrating and heartbreaking. I know words don’t fix anything, but I want to put it out there that I’m here with respect and because I want to listen and learn.

I’m not here to debate politics or war; I just want to connect with people who know and love the culture. So if you don’t mind, I’d love to ask:

* What Palestinian foods or dishes have significance in Palestinian culture?
* Any old or modern musicians, singers, or bands you’d recommend?

New Israeli children are being born, and they deserve to live in peace. The country has a right to exist and defend itself. Period. 

However, there is a limit to how much I, and clearly the vast majority of nations on Earth, are willing to provide grace or benefit of the doubt to Israeli actions. 

Israel is not a permanent good guy. I am American and routinely condemn the US government. In my view, Rumsfeld/Bush/Cheney should be in prison for war crimes. This does not mean I am any less of an American, or anti-American. 

Israel has simply gone too far. It is now committing acts of terror, in response to terrorism. In fact, these recents acts of Israeli terror are even worse than the horrifying acts of terror by Hamas on Oct. 7.

The IDF has:

1. Shot children with sniper ammo.

2. Attacked a UN peacekeeping mission.

3. Raped Palestinian detainees and then actually defended these actions in the highest levels of government. 

4. Attacked and destroyed aid stations, hospitals, schools, and apartment buildings.

5. Killed tens of thousands of people and injured and displaced hundreds of thousands.

6. Purposefully closed access to food, water, and medicine for Gazans.

7. Enforced the illegal settlement of the West Bank and ignored an ICJ ruling on the matter.

The UN Human Rights commission has identified examples of crimes against humanity and repeatedly called on Israel to cease operations in Gaza. 

The vast majority of nations on Earth recognize the excessive and disproportionate nature of IDF actions in Gaza.

Okaloosa County, Florida — On November 12, 2023, Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office Deputies had responded to McLaren Circle around 8:42 a.m. in reference to an initial call of a vehicle driving around honking its horn and disrupting the peace since 3:00 a.m. A second call for service came in from a woman stating her boyfriend, 22-year-old Marquis Jackson, had committed grand theft auto, a felony offense, and had been calling and texting her threats. The victim provided text messages she said had been taken from inside her vehicle showing what appeared to be a firearm suppressor pointing at the dash of the victim’s vehicle. Jackson showed up at the scene around 9:09 a.m. and was detained, searched, handcuffed, and placed in the rear of Deputy Jesse Hernandez’s patrol vehicle while the investigation continued, and the victim completed the affidavit for the stolen vehicle. The victim told deputies Jackson had a silencer and she was not sure where it was and that also he had more than one weapon. As Deputy Hernandez was returning with a Victim’s Rights form for the caller, other deputies found the victim’s vehicle at 1656 Hunt Club Street. 

Deputy Hernandez was approaching the passenger side rear door of his patrol car to do a secondary search of Jackson when he heard a pop sound which he perceived to be a gunshot and believed he had been hit. He began yelling “shots fired” multiple times, falling to the ground and rolling. He fired into the patrol car. After witnessing Deputy Hernandez’s response and reaction, the Sergeant Beth Roberts responded with gunshots towards the car as well in response to the perceived threat. Jackson escaped injury and no weapon was located. Deputy Hernandez had been with the OCSO since January 2022. Sergeant Roberts has been with the OCSO since May 2008. Both were current on resistance training and firearms qualifications. Deputy Hernandez resigned on December 4, 2023, during the investigation but was ultimately found to have violated policy. The deputies were cleared of any criminal wrongdoing. Jackson wasn’t injured, and no weapon was located, the OCSO said. After investigation, the sound was determined to have been made by an acorn hitting the roof of the car.",neutral,neutral,

Then the Terror began:

Lehi (Stern Gang)

	•	Founded: 1940s during British Mandate Palestine

	•	Ideology: Far-right Zionist group that wanted to expel the British and create a Jewish state.

	•	Notable Acts: Assassinated UN envoy Count Folke Bernadotte (1948) and carried out attacks on Arab civilians and British targets.

	•	Labeled as terrorist by the British (controversial figure in Israel’s founding history.)


 Irgun (Etzel)
	•	Founded: 1931, broke away from the Haganah (main Jewish militia)

	•	Notable Acts:

	•	King David Hotel bombing (1946): 91 people killed (British, Arabs, Jews).

	•	Attacks on Arab civilians during the Arab Revolt and 1948 War.

	•	Leaders included Menachem Begin, who later became Israeli Prime Minister.


Kach and Kahane Chai
	•	Founded by: Rabbi Meir Kahane

	•	Ideology: Jewish supremacist, anti-Arab, advocates expulsion of Arabs from Israel and Palestine.

	•	Designated as a terrorist organization by:
	•	Israel itself (after 1994)

	•	United States

	•	European Union

	•	Baruch Goldstein, a follower of Kahane, massacred 29 Palestinian worshippers in Hebron in 1994 (Cave of the Patriarchs massacre).

	•	The movement still has underground supporters today, particularly in parts of the settler community.

Jewish Underground (1980s)
	•	A group of Israeli settlers

 who:
	•	Plotted to blow up the Dome of the Rock.

	•	Planted bombs in cars of Palestinian mayors.

	•	Killed Palestinian students.


	•	Several were arrested and imprisoned, but many were later pardoned or released early, which remains a deep controversy.


Yes — there have been and still are terrorists Jewish/Israeli groups involved in terrorism or acts of violence.




	Menachem Begin.


•	Leader of Irgun (Etzel): A Zionist paramilitary group active during British rule in Palestine (1930s–1940s).


	•	Prime Minister of Israel: 1977–1983 (first Likud Party PM). Benjamin Netanyahu, current party

⸻

Why is he called a terrorist by historians?

Under Begin’s leadership, Irgun carried out attacks that are widely regarded as terrorist acts, including:

1. King David Hotel bombing (1946):
	•	Target: British administrative headquarters in Jerusalem.

	•	Death toll: 91 people (British, Arabs).

2. Deir Yassin massacre (1948):
	•	Joint operation by Irgun and Lehi.

	•	Over 100 Palestinian villagers killed, including women and children.(there was no hamas back then)

	•	This event created mass panic among Palestinians and fueled the 1948 refugee crisis.

They attacked villagers with bombs, back in 1948 ( was there any hamas tunnels,back then?)


	•	Historics: Say he used terrorism to achieve political aims and contributed to ethnic violence.



Who was Yitzhak Shamir?



	•	Born: 1915 in Belarus (then part of the Russian Empire)


	•	PM of Israel:


	•	1983–1984


	•	1986–1992 (longtime Likud leader)


	•	Before entering politics, Shamir was a leader in the Lehi (Stern Gang) — one of the most radical Zionist underground groups.



What Did They Do?



	•	A militant breakaway from Irgun, founded by Avraham Stern.


	•	Goal: Expel the British/Arabs from Palestine and establish a Jewish state.


	•	Used terror tactics, including assassinations and bombings.


	•	Considered a terrorist organization by the British, the Jewish Agency, and even by some other Jewish groups. (Yet He became PM and Likud “current benjamin Netanyahu’s party” FOUNDED BY TERRORISTS!!!!!!)



Yitzhak Shamir’s Role:

Shamir used the alias “Michael” in Lehi. He was part of the leadership and likely approved or helped plan some of the group’s most violent operations.


Notable Lehi Attacks under/around Shamir’s involvement:

1. Assassination of Lord Moyne (1944)


	•	British Minister of State for the Middle East, killed in Cairo by Lehi operatives.



	•	This assassination was condemned worldwide, even by Winston Churchill.




2. Assassination of Count Folke Bernadotte (1948)


	•	A Swedish UN peace envoy, killed in Jerusalem.



	•	He had proposed returning Palestinian refugees and putting Jerusalem under international control.


	•	Lehi killed him, believing he was pro-Arab. ( so let’s kill anyone who doesn’t agree with us)


	•	Israel banned Lehi after this assassination.(🤫🤐 their leader can be our PM tho)WTFFF????


 there’s hard evidence Shamir directly ordered this assassination, he was a top Lehi figure at the time he knew and approved. 



 From Terrorist to Prime Minister…

Like Menachem Begin, Shamir transitioned into politics:


rose through Likud.( BiBi’s current party)


	•	Became PM of Israel, known for a hardline stance on the peace process and refusal to negotiate with the PLO


Viewed by historians as someone with terrorist roots and extreme positions that stalled peace.


	•	Unlike Begin, Shamir never distanced himself from Lehi’s actions, nor did he express regret.( they are Arab dogs of course no regret)


So yes — two men who killed thousands led terrorists groups with terrorist tactics went on to become Prime Ministers of Israel.


Bibi: Im sure everyone saw the vids/pics/audios coming out of Gaza, but:



“The Jordan River will be the border of Israel – not the border of Palestine.”
(Hebrew: “הירדן הוא הגבול שלנו – לא גבול של פלסטין”)

This slogan, or variations of it, have been used repeatedly by Likud politicians, especially by:
	•	Menachem Begin 
(Terrorist)
	•	Yitzhak Shamir
(Terrorist)
	•	Benjamin Netanyahu 
(terrorist)

This slogan clearly means this: 

Ethnic cleansing is the systematic forced removal of ethnic, racial, or religious groups from a given area.


( this exactly what’ve been happening to the Palestinians since 1940)



Total Estimated Killed (1920s–2024):

8,000–9,000 Israelis and Jews have been killed by Palestinians (including civilians and soldiers). 

Total Estimated Killed (1947–2024):

100,000–170,000+ Palestinians, including civilians.




1. European Jews came as refugees.
	•	Starting in the late 1800s, Jews began immigrating to Palestine (then under Ottoman rule), especially fleeing European pogroms and, later, the Holocaust.



	•	Many came with Zionist aspirations — to rebuild a Jewish homeland in what they saw as their ancestral land.




	•	The land, however, was already home to a majority Arab Palestinian population.


2. Armed Zionist militias used violence and terror.
	•	Groups like Irgun, Lehi, and Haganah used violence — including bombings, massacres, and expulsions — to establish Jewish control.

	•	Deir Yassin (1948): over 100 Palestinians killed by Irgun and Lehi — a psychological turning point that led to panic and flight.

	•	Over 750,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled during the Nakba (Catastrophe) in 1947–49.( this is ethnic clenasing)

	•	Some attacks specifically targeted civilian populations to induce fear and drive people out.(this is genocide)


 Today, millions of Palestinians are stateless.
	•	Many are still in refugee camps in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, Gaza, and the West Bank.


	•	Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank live under military occupation, blockade, and severe restrictions.



	•	In East Jerusalem and Israel, Palestinians often face discrimination, home demolitions, and unequal treatment.






Israel is built on genocide,ethnic cleansing,terrorism.

Two weeks ago,reports of Gazans taking it to the streets and protesting against Hamas surfaced online,Gazans screaming their hearts out ""Hamas go away"" ""Al Jazeera go away"" ""We don't want war"",they were actively protesting against Hamas,saying that they cause them suffering and the Palestine solidarity movement? Radio Silence.

The Palestine Solidarity movement and Pro Palestinians in general have been silent about it,and the ones that did respond claimed it was Israeli propaganda,staged by the IDF,the denial was there.

For a people that claim to be the voices of Palestinians they certainly didn't do a great job,all they did was being mouthpieces for Hamas,even the Gazans said it themselves,if you really want to represent their side properly stop westplaining them and start actually listening to what they say,no way that out of all people Gazans will be ones to expose...

If pro palestinians did care about Gazans they would've blasted these protests on social media and took it to the streets,condemning Hamas and demand them to stop repressing Gazan voices,if pro palestinians did care there would've been outrage...

But I couldn't believe that Gazans will be the ones to expose pro palestinians true nature!

You ""care"" for them only when it hurts Israel,you lie for them only when it hurts Israel,you take off to the streets only when it hurts Israel,I am seeing a very clear trend here,when it's against Israel the plan of action is clear but it's against Hamas the protocol is simple: sit down stay quiet and deny everything.

The denial can't continue any longer,the silence can't continue any longer,it's time you face the uncomfortable truth or admit that it was always about Israel.

Israelis are willing to pay any price in order to remove Hamas, so there are only two viable options to stop the carnage in Gaza:

1. Hamas fully surrendered or eradicated from existence. The longer he fights, the more Gaza suffers.

2. All-arab coalition to assault on Israel (won't happen, they barely manage to agree on condemnation)

A right wing zionist terrorist source, which has long disputed the claims of genocide, has made this article. Tell me, if this is not an admission of guilt then what is it? 

&gt; Q: Will traveling become safer after the fighting ends?
&gt; A: The threat may not diminish and could even intensify as Gaza opens to human rights groups and foreign journalists.

Isn’t this literally admitting that the Zionist Occupation isn’t letting things come out and that “the threat” against Zionist Occupiers are going to “intensify” because more people are going to know about the details of said genocide. What problem do all of you genocide supporters have with human rights groups and foreign journalists? 

And what is this?

&gt; Q: Should Israel fund legal defense for soldiers arrested abroad?
&gt; A: If a soldier is wrongly detained for lawful service, the state should cover their defense costs. However, this becomes problematic when there’s credible suspicion of war crimes. Funding one soldier’s defense could set a precedent requiring similar support for others accused of serious crimes.

“Credible suspicion of war crimes”

Oh, but isn’t your terrorist baby killing force “the most moral army in the world”? Isn’t this just admitting that yes, it did commit war crimes? And that there are too much Zionist terrorists for the occupation to defend? Where’s the “Isr*el didn’t commit war crimes” argument again huh? 

&gt; Q: What precautions should be taken before traveling?
A: Soldiers should avoid posting photos or videos from their service, especially content showing destroyed buildings, even if there’s a military justification. Such posts violate operational security and could harm Israel’s image. Some countries might treat seemingly minor content, such as racist songs, as incitement to genocide.

“Even if there’s a military justification”

Isn’t that admitting that sometimes there isn’t “military” justification?

“Could harm Isr*el’s image”

I wonder why people would hate the Zionist Occupation if videos of murdering babies and destroying buildings are being posted.

“Some countries might treat seemingly minor content, such as racist songs, as incitement to genocide.”

Firstly, when has racist songs ever been *minor* content? In what world is that the case? Also how is constantly chanting “DEATH TO ARABS!!!” not incitement to genocide. You are literally advocating for ethnic cleansing, which to be honest is happening as we speak anyways.

18rc68p,2023-12-26,IsraelPalestine,"Help me understand how anyone can support Palestine I really want to get a honest discussion here, not trying to lecture or anything, i just want to understand. 

First of all, I want to say what the definition of zionism is, because most pro palestinians I see here think it means a movement that wants to take and settle palestinian lands. ""Zionism: a movement for (originally) the re-establishment and (now) the development and protection of a Jewish nation in what is now Israel. It was established as a political organization in 1897 under Theodor Herzl, and was later led by Chaim Weizmann."" 

I'm going to give 5 main points that I think cover the reasons I support Israel and why I din't understand why people support palestine.

1.The arab side attacked israel many times before the foundation of Israel- in 1920, twice in 1921, in 1929 and in 1936-1939. While I don't think it justifies the ""Nakba"" I definetly think it gives more background to it. 

2.The arabs rejected a 2 state solution 5 times, I am still in favour of a 2 state soultion but that just shows that it isn't realistic because the palestinian side keeps rejecting the proposals, how do they expect to get peace if they do nothing for it? You can make some arguments for why they rejected it but it doesn't justify refusing 5 times, the offers only get worse just because jewish population growed a lot since the first proposal, and asking them to leave their homes is just as evil as justifying the nakba.

3.Palestinian terror- the palestinian side has almost always attacked first, Israelis living near Gaza must somehow deal with constant fear of missiles, while you can also make the same argument for Gaza residents the Israeli side never starts the attacks and never targets civillians, they attack the Hamas and if innocent civillians die as a result it is indeed sad but not as wrong as targeting civillians.

4.The Hamas October 7th massacre- 1.2~1.3 thousand innocent civillians died in their homes with insane cruelty, many got raped and they even cut a pregnant's lady womb open, beheaded the baby in front of her and then killed her. This is not propagenda, this can be seen in actual footage in websites like thisishamas. Polls show most palestinians support the massacre and while it doesn't justify any murder of any palestinians it does show the problem is not only with Hamas, many civillians even joined the massacre and many welcomed the terrorists with candies.

5. I might be wrong on this one but Palestinians could have claimed a palestinian land in Gaza in the west bank pretty much this whole time, why didn't they?",anti,pro,

One of the Ukraine soldiers open fire and puts a couple of rounds through the flimsy door of this garden shed. Right at that point the door flung open and a russian armed soldier who was hiding inside the shed stumbles out, takes a few step before the rest of the Ukraine squad fire multiple bursts of rounds, mainly to his torso. The Russian soldier is still moving out of the shed at this point, trying to run away by getting in between two clusters of Ukraine soldiers.

1j8qwsq,2025-03-11,NonCredibleDefense,"Fiber Optic cables and how you are wrong about them Hi guys, i see a lot of talk about optic fiber communications and cables, and understandably there is a lot of confusion.

the main take is that fiber optic is fragile: correct but heavily misinterpreted. The fiber itself is extremely fragile, but no one, literally no one uses it without cladding and the rest of the goddamn cable. all the cable does in your common office green or yellow office cable is preventing the cable from bending too much. you have to reall apply a lot of pressure to break the cable, accidental bumps will not break it. if the cable ist too bent (with a turning radius tighter then circa a ping pong ball) you will start to lose signal. you will not snap it. you will only lose some signal. i cant say it enough, snapping the fibre requires you to physically cut it or snap it willingly.

Another take is the overall fragility of cables, not being able to use heavy machinery on top them: false, but you are not stupid, you just dont know the correct cables to use. There are in very common use cables for external use rated for being used in farms, capable of resisting heavy machinery, like farm equipment. these cables have metal cores shielding, and can bring with them up to 48 fibers. you can put them a bit underground to be sure, not a lot, just shove them under some dirt and they are now very difficult to find or break. to be fair im not sure if it can withstand a tank, but anything else is no problem

Fibre optic is expensive: False. just false. it was true time ago, now the conveniency alone makes it superior to copper. the real issue is training peoples to work with it. thats a challenge, its not that easy. still you can work with it in a construction site with concrete powder in the air constantly, working on it in a trench on a calm day is doable. the equipment to join fibre optics costs few hundred to few thousand euros and its becoming widespread. the time required to fuse 2 end togheter is some minutes.

true issues: infrastructure, like switches, modules, hardware stuff in general still more expensive and not widespread compared to copper, workers, not trained nearly enough, deliverability, Fiber optic can become very heavy very fast. its not as easy as plugging in starlink or dragging a thinner telephonic wire

Advantages: Fiber is not jammable in any way shape or form. it does not need power to deliver signals to stupidly long distances

  
if you all need schematics to better understand i can work on a second post explaining how these cables are built more specifically

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has not stopped spreading. It is still causing severe disease and are killing people. Protests are crowded areas, where the risk of getting infected with SARS-CoV-2 is high. What's wrong with protestors wearing a face mask to protect themselves from a virus that can kill them? As long as SARS-CoV-2 keeps spreading around, what's wrong with wearing face masks while protesting?

****

Explanation of how the virus kills: 

SARS-CoV-2 primarily enters the body through the respiratory system. The virus uses its spike proteins to bind to ACE2 receptors, which are found in high concentrations in the lungs, particularly on type II alveolar cells. Once inside cells, the virus hijacks cellular machinery to replicate.

The infection typically starts in the upper respiratory tract and can progress to the lower respiratory tract. As it spreads in the lungs, it causes inflammation and damage to the alveoli, the tiny air sacs responsible for oxygen exchange. This damage leads to:

Pneumonia: Inflammation of the lung tissue, causing fluid buildup in the alveoli.

Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Severe inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, seriously impairing oxygen exchange.

The body's immune response, while necessary to fight the virus, can sometimes become overactive, leading to a ""cytokine storm."" This hyperinflammatory state can cause widespread damage throughout the body, affecting multiple organ systems, ultimately causing death in severe cases.",neutral,neutral,

A lot of good discussions have gotten lost to new activity and I thought it would be a nice idea to highlight those posts and comments that changed your opinion or opened your eyes to how other people see things.

We all saw what happened between Zelenskyy and Trump in the Oval Office. A foreign leader talking like that to the President in public is very rare. But it has happened before between Netanyahu and Obama. Zelenskyy could learn a thing or two from Netanyahu in terms of diplomacy against a hostile US President and how to withstand pressures and manipulate until you reach your goal:

When Obama arrives in the White House, he is full of courage to try to force a Palestinian state on Israel. Rahm Emanuel even declared that a Palestinian state would be established within 4 or 3 years (in 2009). Netanyahu, for 8 years under pressure, has learned to maneuver and withstand pressure. How?

First, Bar Ilan's speech. Bar Ilan's speech embodies the ""Bibi tactic"": vague recognition of the idea of ​​a Palestinian state, but with clear conditions and red lines that will allow him to buy time and receive international credit. Bibi set clear conditions at Bar Ilan: security control, a united Jerusalem, recognition of a Jewish state

Bibi entered into negotiations with Abbas, but continued to set the usual conditions and in every document of a possible agreement, Bibi always makes sure that he has the option to insert new reservations and conditions. Abbas refused, and Bibi bought time. Obama tried to force Bibi to halt construction in Jerusalem. Bibi again successfully turned Congress against him through messages (""Dog Whistling"") and when Obama attempted to force a withdraw to the 1967 lines, this led to this moment

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4Z\_JBG1sOk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4Z_JBG1sOk)

Bibi stalled time, exhausted the system, showed a willingness to make one move or another, but always with conditions and reservations that allowed him to gain time, but in the process, he played carefully and didn't break the dishes with the American president so as not to get himself into problematic situations (Aside the speech in Congress, but even then he did that when he had the backing of Congress and an important portion of the American public opinion) and thus wait for the right moment and the right international climate to reveal his goal. He stalled for time and played ""defensive"" until Obama left the White House, and when Trump entered in 2016 and there was the right international climate (Netanyahu successfully paralyzed the EU and blocked it from applying pressure on Israel through his alliance with the Visergard states) we saw that Netanyahu had already stopped talking about the peace process and went on the offensive: gaining settlements, an attempt (which failed) to apply sovereignty in Judea and Samaria, and then the Abraham Accords.

This is the strategy: show willingness but set ironclad conditions and many reservations that will allow you to buy time and softly repel the pressures, and at the appropriate moment, wisely pursue the goal (We also see it now in the plan to relocate Gazans)",neutral,neutral,

1cs7lvg,2024-05-15,IsraelPalestine,"Question to the Pro-Israeli Side Regarding Military to Civilian Casualty Ratios Hamas in its October 7th attack, while true that some civilians were killed, attacked a significant number of military targets. Here's the official casualty figures, as put out **by Israel:**

**Total killed:** 1,143


**Security Forces Killed:** 376

This includes on duty police officers, military, and other professional security personnel -- all legitimate military targets.


**Civilians:** 767

IDF Reservists were included in this figure as ""civilians,"" as well as Active Duty IDF soldiers that were not officially ""on duty."" Thus, it's a total distortion of the facts.

Out of those 767 ""civilians,"" there were literally hundreds of IDF soldiers included in that number. Them being ""off duty"" does not take away from them being legitimate military targets, unless you also condemn Israel for targeting Hamas fighters when they are ""off duty,"" and at home with their families, for example.

If Ukraine were to fly a drone into Russian territory, and strike a barracks full of Russian conscripts that were ""off duty,"" and not currently engaged in active combat, this would be a legitimate attack, and not terrorism. 

**MY QUESTION TO THE PRO-ISRAELI SIDE IS THE FOLLOWING:**

***What does the ratio need to be for it to be not considered ""terrorism?"" What would those numbers need to look like?***

Because it seems that pro-Israeli people want to make any armed resistance to Israel terrorism, or wrong and discredited by default. It doesn't matter if Hamas targets military targets or not, it will still **always** be labelled as ""terrorism"" and criticized it seems.

**Also, keep in mind that even the official, disingenuous numbers, as listed by Israel, of 376 out of 1,143 is** ***STILL*** **a better ratio of military to civilians targeted than Israel's numbers.**

There were also many Israeli civilians killed as a result of the IDF (Hannibal Directive). We don't know the actual numbers for this, but we know for a fact that many Israeli civilians were killed in ""friendly fire"" incidents, whether truly on accident, or deliberate, or both. This could very well be dozens or even hundreds.

The music festival was also an unaccounted for situation. There happened to be many more civilians in the area as a result. It's clear from the numbers, however, that Hamas' objectives were largely military. Any civilians that were truly civilians, as well as minors, are obviously tragedies, and I condemn those specific incidents. However, the revolutionary movement of the Palestinians, of which for better or worse Hamas is a key armed group, is not discredited because some injustices were committed. Unless you feel the IDF as a whole is completely discredited, and should lay down their arms as a result of their atrocities. What's good for one is good for the other. 

The same standards should be used when assessing any belligerents in a conflict. The IDF doesn't gain special status, or the benefit of the doubt, or any other privileges not afforded to Hamas as well, just because they're ""the good guys"" and are fighting Hamas, who are ""the bad guys."" In war, **both** sides believe they are the good guys, and the other side are the bad guys, so that's not an objective reality. As such, the same standard must always be used, regardless of side.

** **Edit To Add This: I understand the futility of arguing with the pro Israel side. And that has been reinforced with this post. However, this post serves as good information for others in the future that may happen across it, as it puts Israeli hypocrisy on full display, and it refutes the false narrative of** ***""1200 innocent civilians massacred.""***",anti,pro,

1cpmunu,2024-05-11,IsraelPalestine,"UN halves reported death count by Gazan Authorities. We told you so.

By December of this war, the reported deaths by the Gazan Health Authority would have made this the deadliest conflict since WW2 - more deaths in 3 months, than for each year of every war since then - the numbers were astronomical and completely unbelievable immediately - I won’t even go into how they would have been able to identify the amount of dead so quickly; the USA for example is still identifying dead from 9/11 attacks.

 It was impossible on every level. In every way. 

The ability to so quickly identify the dead ( and the dead being so easily identified ) was not possible. The ability to keep track of the dead - was not possible - not with all the other reports of no hospital services or power outages or lack of cell service and internet or even healthcare services - none of it added up on any level at any time. The lies contradicted the lies. 

What is sad, is that this won’t go viral. This will be largely unnoticed by the world. People won’t care. People will still put their faith 100% into the Gazan Authority; even though they have been proven liars over and over again at this point. Pretty much everything they say, is a lie. 

Please don’t misunderstand me- all civilian deaths are a tragedy and I am saddened that these children are dead and I am sad that any child is a victim of war. It’s sad. It is. 

This war was inspired by unspeakable acts of terror that were not invited or justified. The acts of terror - for me validated Israeli policy. If anything. 

America wants to build a wall between us and Mexico so we can keep out hard working immigrants that just want a better life for their children- imagine if we lived next door to Islamic terrorists who shot rockets at us every day.  Who killed at least 100 American citizens every year in terror attacks on average. 

What would we do? 

Do we honestly think we would not guard our borders with an army ?

 Look at our security lines to just board an airplane-which is the direct result of terrorist attacks. Our watch lists. Our laws that have changed. Our lack of privacy. All the result of a terrorist attack.

Studying the 1948 war and its consequences is a very prolonging and (also very confusing) draining thing to do, so help me out here. I've seen argument from the Palestinian that the UN partition plan was not fair and that the reason for the rejection was due to the land not being evenly distributed to the Arabs, (45 percent to them and 55 percent to the Jews) ignoring the fact that they rejected a plan that gave them 80% plus percent of the land in 1937.   
 

But what percentage of land in the mandate was owned by each side? I've seen numbers like 75 percent was owned by the mandate itself and that it was public land, or other numbers that arabs actually owned up to 50 percent of the land, and Jews only 5-8%. So can someone clarify this for me? I've did some research but keep coming to the conclusion of ""This source is telling me one thing, but this other is telling me another"" 

One source I found was from the British foreign office located in Haifa at the time, and it said 76% of the land was state land, and the remaining was split evenly between Arabs and Jews and other Arab absentee landlords who didnt even live in the mandate at the time. But according to the village statistics of 1945 only 3 years prior, Arabs owned 48.5 percent of the land. and Jews only owning 5.67% and public land actually only being 5.56%.

It led me to some very interesting discoveries and are as follows:

1. The civilized and democratic West supports the Jews and has provided them military aid to defend themselves and exist in their homeland while the Global South with authoritarian countries stand with Palestine

2. More men in the West support the Jews while more females empathize with the suffering of Palestine.

3. The experienced and knowledgable older folks such as the boomers support the Jews while naive younger generations tend to support Palestine (eg. Encampments and TikTok videos).

4. Conservatives and Republicans support the Jews and regard them as Chosen People while Liberals and Left-Wingers tend to support the Palestine struggle for liberation.

5. Straight people clearly support the Jews while homosexuals and other LGBTQ groups support Palestine (even though Palestine does not return the favor).

6. White people in the West support the Jews while colored people especially brown ones are in solidarity with Palestine.

7. In Europe, hard working European countries such as Germany support the Jews and have learnt from the Holocaust while lazy Mediterranean ones like Spain and drunk ones like Ireland support Palestine.

8. People with jobs support the Jews while unemployed folks reliant on welfare support Palestine (eg activists in encampments and ones destroying Elbit systems in UK)

9. The police and military who care about defending the nation and rule of law support the Jews while human-rights activists, peace activists, and open-borders campaigners stand with Palestine.

10. Christians across the world support the Jews and consider them as their brothers or Chosen People and subscribe to Judeo-Christian values that define the enlightened West while Muslims across the world support Palestine and many wish to wage jihad against the Jews.

11. Sunni Arab governments support the Jews and are trying to make their populace love the Jews while Shia countries stand with Palestine.

12. Business oriented people with acumen and scientists in academia keen on discovery and new technology support the Jews while social scientists, artists, humanities students and other outlandish unrealistic idealists support Palestine. 

13. Hollywood wholeheartedly supports the Jews while alternative cinema goers and exhibitors support Palestine.

Personally, I have no dog in the fight and don't care who owns what bit of land over there and I'm not a Jew or a Muslim. What I do hate, is all the innocent civilians that have been stuck in the middle of the conflict and have been killed who are just wanting a normal life, whether it be Israelis, Palestinians, Jews or Muslims.

I know this conflict has really been going on for decades, way before the Oct 7th invasion/massacre and this whole Gaza conflict is a hot geopolitical mess.

Even though I absolutely hate religion and think all of it is mental (and that includes Christianity), I actually have family members that are Muslim and of course, they are always going on about the atrocities of innocent Palestinian children being bombed etc, which I agree is absolutely fucked, however they also use it to paint the story that all Jews are evil blah blah blah which I find very hard to swallow and isn't something I'm comfortable with.

When you watch the actual invasion from last year, and see HAMAS murdering innocent civilians that have nothing to do with the IDF (Nova music festival as one example), how can you condone and support that group, whose actions were the reason IDF started bombing Gaza (again?).

Again, I know this area has a very complicated past with a lot of blood shed, and there is a lot of eye for an eye stuff going on here, but how can you paint Isreal/IDF as being completely evil while showing the suffering the Palestinians have endured, but also act as if HAMAS haven't done anything wrong when they clearly have?

As messed up as it is to say it, I can't help but just see it as both sides are both as bad as each other, and the only result is that innocent lives in that region are suffering, and that alone is absolutely shit to see, regardless of who's at fault.

---dinosaurs launching rockets 

---etc. 

I'm aware IDF soldiers are human, and that many are little more than children themselves. Humour is a coping mechanism, and much of it can be written off as trying to laugh off their very real apprehension of being sent to a war from which they may never return. Every man and woman in uniform runs the risk of their latest video being their last. So they pretend it's all a joke so they can at least pretend to be the tough cookies Israelis are supposed to be. 

But what might have been funny in a letter home to Mom and Dad in 1974, in a cringey sort of way (not to mention 1944 or even 1914) looks like the height of tactlessness in 2024, to say the least of it. 

IDF top brass know, or should know, that allowing troops to release such videos to people in the outside world who don't have all the context may result in IDF troops being seen as uniformly heartless sociopaths and finding the bloodbath in Gaza a source of amusement, not horror---and the IDF, not to say the State of Israel, being brought into disrepute. 

So why is this tolerated? It makes a mockery of more official Israeli government messaging that Israel did not choose lightly to respond to October 7 as she did, and that in fact the IDF are proudly the most moral army in the world and do not relish the job they have gone to Gaza to do. 

Whether or not you accept the Israeli official stance, the videos made by IDF grunts to give themselves a laugh don't make it any easier to persuade the world that Israel is the good guy here (a world already not always inclined to give Israel, or Israelis, the benefit of the doubt).

Can someone who knows a bit more about Israeli folkways give some insight?

It goes through how the IDF uses human shields to reduce IDF casualties. Instead of using modern technology in the year 2024 that the most moral and advanced army in the world would have access to, it seemed easier to use Palestinian civilians to test whether or not an area was booby trapped.

I am relatively sure that most, including most who oppose the protests, are well aware of these facts and the attempt to smear this explosion of activism as pro-Hamas is (obviously) just a cynical ploy which appears (to me anyway) to have the aim of discrediting the protest movement in general and/or trying to get them to shut up for fear of being labelled as pro-terrorism. For the record, if that is the plan, I really don't think it's working. At all!

By the way, this is all so incredibly similar to post 9-11 discourse as in back then, protesters against the planned Iraq invasion were labelled as ""pro-Saddam"". And we all know just how well that particular military adventure turned out.

When I've asked people to justify calling the protests ""pro Hamas marches"" most often I've been told that actually, most people on the marches or occupying buildings on college campuses secretly actually really support Hamas (even though what they are actually saying is that they would like the IDF to stop destroying Gaza, or at least they don't want to help pay for the destruction and killing with their taxpayer's money) and the reason to be sure that they're really pro Hamas is because......"" 

What then follows is usually some convoluted diatribe which will usually seek to minimise the differentiation between Palestinian combatants and civilians in a way that suggests any actions or speech which is in any way pro-Palestinian therefore inherently must also be pro Hamas.

Acting like all Palestinians are the same so you can make judgements about the character of them all based simply on their racial demographic is by definition racism! For illustration, it would be just as racist to presume all Israelis are in favour preventing aid trucks from reaching Gaza and assaulting the drivers just because this is what a small group of settlers is doing.

1jrpmfd,2025-04-04,IsraelPalestine,"Why you see so much media coverage about Israel The founder of Islam, Muhammad, had a vision: unite the world into a perfect utopia by conquering all of it. Under his leadership, and after he died, Arab Muslims came out of Arabia  conquered the entire Middle East and half of Africa. They even conquered Spain and France for a while before being driven out. All pagans were to be converted or killed. Jews and Christians were permitted to live as second class citizens.

So for centuries, Jews, Christians, and Muslims lived in “peace” the same way black Americans lived in “peace” during the Jim Crow era: you were mostly safe as long as you accepted your second class status. At times, Jews were not allowed to ride horses, because they couldn't be taller than Muslims. They had to pay Jew taxes that left them impoverished. They could hold no positions of power. And of course, absolutely no non-Muslims were permitted to have any kind of self determination. No no-Muslims countries, period.

 In 1948, for the first time in centuries, Israel broke that mold. Non-Muslims took over territory in the Middle East. The tiniest piece of territory imaginable, but territory, nonetheless. This was a humiliation of a scale never experienced in the Muslim world. The Muslim world knew immediately, and knows today, that it must eliminate this challenge to Islam’s complete domination of the Middle East.

That’s why Muslims obsess over Israel. It’s not because of displacement or conflict deaths. Far greater numbers have been displaced in the Middle East in wars between Muslim groups. Wars in Syria and Yemen recently, for instance, have killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions. And yet, Muslims still obsess over Israel. Because Jews are not Muslims. Because Jews are not supposed to have any territory.

This is why media coverage of Israel is so massive. This is why the UN condemns Israel more each year than the rest of the world combined. This is why, when Westerners open TikTok, they see more devastation in Gaza than they did in Syria or Yemen, or the dozens of other massive Middle Eastern conflicts in their lifetime. Because 1/3 of the world is Muslim, and they are on TikTok, and they hate Israel.

When well-meaning Westerners (and plenty of well-meaning Muslims, and people in other places) see this obsessive media coverage of Israel, they simply respond emotionally, thinking they are seeing so much because the scale of the humanitarian crisis is so big. They are not. They are seeing this coverage because the Muslim world has a vendetta against Jews having any kind of control in an area that is “supposed” to be dominated by Muslims.

Muslims further appeal to the West by saying Israel is guilty of everything the West hates to today: Apartheid, Genocide, Colonialism, Racism, and every negative word they can think of. And Westerners buy it up. They do not stop to wonder why they are obsessing over a relatively small-scale war on the other side of the world, when they have ignored every larger war in their lifetimes. They do not wonder why they are targeting the same group of people that their ancestors cast out of Spain, or threw down wells in England, or mass murdered in Germany. Minorities are scapegoated because they are so small, that they get drowned out by the much larger voices of the majority. This has happened to Jews throughout history, and it's happening to the Jewish country today.

That’s why Pro-Palestinians often think they are not antisemitic: because they, personally, do not think Jews must be subservient or die. They are simply following those who do.",pro,anti,

1bmgazq,2024-03-24,AskMiddleEast,"Are we eating grass to survive in Gaza People often inquire about how we manage to sustain ourselves with food and supplies. When we are not being killed by guns and bombs.

Before the conflict, staple dishes like falafel sandwiches, seasoned with zaatar and olive oil, were considered food for the poor. Regrettably, even falafels have become scarce in Gaza's markets due to a shortage of chickpeas and the soaring cost of vegetable oil.

It might sound unbelievable, but desperate families have resorted to consuming grass to stave off hunger.

A modest iftar meal typically comprises potatoes, bread, beans, and canned foods like tuna. Such a meal can set one back an astounding $120 - 150 for those fortunate enough to locate and afford the necessary supplies.

The expense of cooking oil has skyrocketed to approximately $30 per liter. In northern Gaza, a 25kg bag of flour is being sold for as much as $400. Fortunately, in Rafah, where I reside, prices fluctuate between $50 and $100. Sugar is now priced at roughly $20 per kilogram. A single egg sells for about $1, and a gallon of drinking water costs one shekel, equivalent to 28 cents.

At times, we resort to consuming bread made from animal feed due to exorbitant flour prices. Even when we manage to acquire a bag of flour, it's risky to bring it home, as we might fall prey to robbery by desperate individuals in the streets. However, it's hard to blame them given the circumstances.

Currently, my primary concern revolves around securing enough flour to last us through the remaining days of Ramadan. However, this seems like a distant dream. At present, we can barely afford anything and must rely on the generosity of our neighbors to eat meals 1 - 2  times a week.

**P.S.: I've noticed comments on my previous posts** suggesting that I don't sound like a typical Gazan woman. What exactly should a Gazan woman sound like? I am a lecturer at one of the universities here—sorry, I was. I studied English literature in a Western country and graduated top of my class. Those implying otherwise have taken everything from us and now presume to dictate how a Gazan should speak. I won't allow it.

I was also very disappointed by the reaction to the rise of antisemitism internationally, and the dismissing of Jewish voices throughout.

Since then things have gotten worse, I've been called a liberal, a Zionist, and a Islamophobe whenever I've contradicted 'friend's POVs, this is posed as an insult as I am a Marxist, and have been active in such politics for 7 years. But my opinion, apparently, is far more nuanced than such labels can comprehend. I wouldn't think being against Islamic radicalism and terrorism would be so complicated but apparently in these circles they are.

It is confusing to me, coming from an angle that (generally) see's student protests as historically culturally progressive, (I know this is not always the case). The demonstrations are diverse and left wing, but I have also seen something within this movement that means it can not be looked at in the same way we looked at the anti-Vietnam or SA's apartheid student movements of the past. These previous movements didn't have fringe sections that cause literal harm to minorities on campus, and for those that refute that, I've seen lives and videos from said demonstrations chanted some of the following (in quite large numbers):  
-We don't want no two state, we want 48  
-go back to Poland (Arab americans students to Jewish americans)  
- All the land of Palestine will be Arab in our lifetime  
- B0mb Tel Aviv, burn it to the ground  
-H@m@s we support you, we support your rockets too  
Not to mention physical violence that has been reported extensively.

I spoke with my one far-left friend that I know doesn't support terror groups like my previous political friends now do, he is also American so I thought could shed more light. (I am very confused and don't know what to support). He said that those narratives are extremely unpopular and not what the student movement stands for at all, and there are active Jewish students involved, with teach-outs on anti-Semitism, and those few individuals are casting a bad light on the wider movement. I would like to think he is right, and perhaps it is different in the US, but I am sceptical. I am yet to see ANY  
left wing orgs critiquing praise for H@m@s, Iran, H£zb0llah and H0uthis, and I know there is a fear there to do so as to be seen to be siding with Israel, or the war.

I'm interested if anyone has a perspective on the protests that is nuanced, not so black and white, perhaps from other left wing people, that are either pro or anti these camps.

I know in present day the Israeli/Palestinian conflict has layers of complexity and in recent years has taken a sharp turn for the worse.

Looking back on when Israel was established as a state— Yes I recognize that there’s more history past 1948, and that historically Jewish people have had connections to this land through the kingdoms of Israel and Judah— It seems like France wanted no part in dealing with the land and handed it to the UK, and the UK essentially just gave up dealing with the situation after an incredibly messy immigration situation and gave the responsibility to the UN. 

It seems like historically, Palestinian civilians did not favor the later years of the Ottoman Empire, and sure as hell did not favor the British Mandate. While I do agree that the Jewish Diaspora after WWII needed a safe haven and this land was the best option considering its historical ties— Could there have been ANY way for this to have been less disastrous? It seems as though the Palestinian civilians at the time wanted to self-govern after the collapse of the Ottoman empire.

I know the United Kingdom doesn’t have a very great track record with peaceful affairs and their history with colonialism all over the world… and I personally don’t think they would’ve handled this situation any different.

1nhzwk0,2025-09-15,IsraelPalestine,"My thoughts on the relationship between Jews and Zionism, as a non-Jewish anti-Zionist. For starters, I am a non-Jewish transgender leftist who was raised with both mainline Protestant and Roman Catholic influences, who today identifies as a Unitarian Universalist. I have an interest in Semitic cultures and languages, particularly that of the Levantine Arabs (Lebanese, Syrians, Palestinians, and Jordanians), but also Aramaeans/Syriacs and Jews. I am studying Levantine Arabic and I have a vague curiosity in practicing a progressive form of Islam, although I understand that they could be criticized as hypocritical given the Quran's stance on LGBTQ people, but I feel a connection to Islamic theology and practice otherwise. 

On Israel/Palestine, I am against the existence of the State of Israel historically and into the present day. I believe that Israel was founded unjustly, and that all living Palestinians have the legitimate Right of Return to the homes of their recent ancestors. However, I recognize that Zionism was borne out of justified concerns over antisemitism, and I believe that, in theory, it is justified to believe that Jews have a right to live in their ancient homeland. Where I differ from practical Zionism, though, is that I don't believe that it was justifiable to force any Palestinian Arabs from their homes in order to facilitate the process of building the Jewish State. 

Therefore, I would like to know what this community has to say about the fact that the overwhelming majority of Jews today (both in Israel and abroad) identify as Zionists. Anti-zionism and antisemitism are not the same thing because Zionism is a political ideology and antisemitism is bigotry against a particular group. Neither is anti-Americanism the same as bigotry against the people of the United States. The only way to claim that being anti-zionist is the same as being antisemitic is if you define the return of Jewish people to their ancient homeland as being core to Jewish identity. 

Still, it's important to reiterate that most Jews identify as Zionists. Therefore, those for who support Palestinian liberation, how is it possible to disentangle Jewish identity from Zionism? Zionists have carefully crafted a narrative that Zionism is inseparable from Jewish identity, and most Jews embrace that narrative. I disagree with Zionism but recognize that Zionism may have, at one time, had noble ideals. Is Zionism at all redeemable in the present day? I would say no, but that has more to do with real-life implications than the vague idea of Jews having a right to live in their ancient homeland being inherently evil or wrong. 

I understand that I'm rambling and my thoughts are disjointed, but is it possible to be genuinely anti-Zionist and still not support the forcible expulsion of Israelis from Palestine? Because in my heart of hearts, I feel genuine antipathy to the State of Israel and what Zionism looks like in practice, but I also don't want any Israelis to be forced to leave. My personal priority for the region is to disband the State of Israel, have Western governments rebuild Gaza on behalf of its current residents and see the facilitation of living Palestinians being allowed to return to the homes of their parents and grandparents if they so choose. I just don't see how this ideal is possible without forcing some Israelis to leave the region. Ultimately, I identify with the Palestinians and support one state where everyone has equal rights, but I don't see how this is possible given the dynamics at play.",anti,pro,
1mvnmuh,2025-08-20,IsraelPalestine,"Honestly........... How can people still believe that hamas is handily beating Israel in military terms? Not winning the PR War, not boasting that a new insurgency will come to kick out the colonial settlers, not calling out Israel as a paper tiger for October 7 and then using statistics of casualties in the Gaza and West Bank fighting since 2023 to support that notion, not even claiming that HAMAS will soon come out as victors as the tides is changing and Iran is slowly being dragged into war against America and the West and the rest of the Arab world will gradually get pulled in............

But as in literally lots of people believe that HAMAS squads are beating the IDF effortlessly!!!! That in every engagement lots of Israeli soldiers are being killed for every single HAMAS insurgent and HAMAS squds have just slaughtered entire IDF platoons!

I kid you not I just saw these kinds of comments on Youtube and few Tumblr posts recently even a few on Reddit as well. And not just from Arabs, other Muslims, college students, radical liberals but even neutrals who say they are parroting what t they saw online!

This is the completely pinnacle of insanity. Whatever side you are on be you a PLO supporter, Zionist, Republican, Democrat, Libertarian, Communist, military hobbyist, Wumao, white Aryan Supremacist, conservative Arab immigrant,and so on, by all and any metrics Gaza is has been blown to smithereens and West Bank also experienced some damages, lots of civilians are dead, and practically all of HAMAS 's frontline fighting forces have been wiped out esp their grunt infantry and moreso their crack troops.

So to see comments like this as late as August 20, 2025 is sheer and complete insanity! How can people still literally believe HAMAS is still an effective fighting organization who is massacring tons of IDF units and is winning the war on ground?!

The posts are so unbelievable that after rereading them before deciding to write this I ultimately decided not to quote them and share links. Because I'm completely at a loss that people still believe this. Esp when you take into account that many actual Palestine supporter subs now have been putting up daily posts complaining about how civilians are being slaughtered and some posters even admitting starting this war was the worst mistake to ever happen and regret they ever eagerly cheered for the IDF to come at Gaza for a fight.

Whatever side you're on be you support ISIS or Haredis and the Evangelicals whatever group, there is no way you can deny HAMAS suffered gigantic losses that are bordering fatal and unrecoverable and continue to believe they are just a step away from winning and demolishing the IDF.

Why the hell are there people who still genuinely believe this? Esp when a noticeable amount of Muslims online now lament that the Palestinian territory is destroyed and the Arab resistance has been shattered since as early as late 2024? Despite that actual Arabs are now saying so much suffering has come from the war and the PLO cause is doomed (esp the hopes for a two states resolution), it seems tons of online Western  non-Muslim posters esp on the Left still believe HAMAS is just a few months away from winning!",pro,anti,

1mk1xcn,2025-08-07,AskMiddleEast,"How many ""Middle Eastern"" countries are actually peaceful? I'm getting tired of hearing something along the lines of ""there is no peace in the Middle East"" from people around me, people in my country and people all over the Internet and in the news. When they say this, I still can't make out if they mean ""Middle East"", the region; or just ""all Muslim majority countries"" or ""all Arabic-speaking countries"". It may be a combination of all 3 too. You can hear the condescending tone in their voice when they say it irl and I know for sure many who say it mean either one or more of these

So I want to hear from the people who actually live there about this.

Due to the nature and tone of the phrase itself when I hear it, I extend the question to Muslim-majority countries and Arabic speakers. So anyone in the sub who can answer this for those two as well are welcome to. But the literal sense of the question does only pertain to the geographical region itself, which is why I ask it here.

Going off the latest world safety index, I found that Kuwait was above my country of Norway on the safety index. A Muslim-majority country in the Middle East. Malaysia as well (a Muslim majority country, but not ME). From previous years I also found Qatar, Oman, Bahrain and UAE higher than my country on the list. Even Saudi seemed high on the list multiple years. Indonesia isn't as high on the list, but I've read many places that it is safe.

From personal interest in these countries, Oman and UAE certainly seem like safe countries and the people there seem happy, as well as in Qatar. Saudi seems peaceful too.

So before I extend the question out to the sub. I will specify some things:  
\- By ""Middle East"" I will use the definition from the tone I hear when people say it and consequent sentences they say. This means ME as a region, Muslim-majority countries as well as Arabic-speaking ones. I of course only expect answers from the region itself in this sub, but if anyone knows about the others, feel free to add your word here.  
\- By ""Peace"" I mean a low rate of crime, that people in the country feel safe and looked after, and no presence of trrrrrrst groups.

Hope to hear your answers and thank you!",neutral,neutral,

The evidence is presented right in front of you. The first line of the HAMAS charter states ‘Israel will exist ans will continue to exist until Islam will obliterate it, just as it has obliterated others before it.’. Furthermore, the events on Oct. 7 have also shown the brutality of HAMAS, which is on par with ISIS and Al-Qaeda. 

And before anyone says the attacks were fabricated by the IDF, you are deluded. The footage was published by HAMAS themselves and they proudly claim these attacks. 

HAMAS also uses the Palestinian people as human shields so they can claim the morale high ground when people die. News flash: war is not a numbers game. The Germans lost more than the British and Americans combined in WW2, so can you say the Germans were victims? 

Peace in the Middle East will only come when both sides want peace. And for now, all I can see is that peace has been rejected vehemently by the terrorist orgs in the West Bank and Gaza.

11) wanting to amplify any Palestinian voice or Pro Palestine voice regardless of if they're a good voice or not 

I had a HS friend of mine thinks this particular Palestinian voice is good to amplify and this guy calls Israelis settlers, supports Hamas and rejects normalization, there are so many Palestinian voices I follow on twitter who don't do this and I can tell they do want peace and they talk about the hostages, criticize Hamas and Israel.

12) Sending death threats or rape threats to Israelis or banning Israelis for traveling the country

I heard stories from Israelis who talk about all the horrible racism and death threats and rape threats they get and it's so disgusting. Hate the israeli government all you want but don't just hate the people for where they come from and make rape threats that's disgusting

13) make the conflict about race or using skin cancer as an argument 

Luckily some Pro Palestine people on twitter pushed back against the skin cancer argument but it's so silly. I read elsewhere that Lebanese people have high amounts of skin cancer but nobody says Lebanese people don't have ties to Lebanon, regarding skin color there's light skin Palestinians but nobody says anything about it. It's just again racism. Underneath comments about Maldives banning Israelis from going there (such a shame, lost respect for Maldives) this is again racism, I know other countries also ban Israelis but to me it's just racism and underneath the post I saw so many pro Palestine people making comments about Israelis having dual citizenship (only 13% do I think, majority don't have any other passport)

14) saying there's no such thing as Israeli food or it's stolen food

As a foodie myself Israeli food is inspired by the mizrahi Jews and sephardic Jews and Ashkanazi jews who immigrated there and by the Palestinian citizens of Israel. It seems like food is the least important thing in this conflict, all food is inspired by the people they came in contact with, inspired by other countries cuisine plus a lot of israeli staples are found throughout the Middle East but it seems like only Israel gets criticized for silly things like their food

15) Representing palestinian culture with things like the conflict

I get why they they want to talk about it, as well as talking about the Keffiyah but I think palestinian music, dances, food, and other things should be show cased a lot. Maybe those things are shown a lot and I don't see it but it would be nice to represent Palestinian culture with more than just the conflict.

16) claiming that Pro Hamas sentiment is a small portion of their supporters 

I would say a sizeable chunk hold these stances regarding Hamas. Even my bf had to admitt he was wrong on his assumption that it was some small bad apples. In Crownheights Brooklyn I saw a rally where a women waved a Hamas flag with a headband and a pink keffiyah hiding her face, the org who organized the rally is pro Hamas naming their rallies after october 7th, in Toronto I saw a rally where they took a break from marching to play a speech by Abu Obeida and nobody said anything about it, there were rallies  supporting October 7th when it happened, people chanting nuke telaviv, or telling Jews to go back to Poland

17) claiming anti zionist can never be anti semitic or a sizeable portion isn't 

I'll be reasonable and say it doesn't have to be but often times it is, and I'm seen a lot of anti zionist sentiment disguised as anti zionism (zio as a slur, zionist control of the media, United States of Israel and comments such as that)

18) not calling out the Pro Hamas sentiment at the rallies

If you don't want these pro Hamas supporters to distract from the situation in Gaza then calling it out is important it might make people who are anti war and other Jews from feeling more comfortable at the rallies if they wanted to attend

19) mocking hostages and removing Hostages posters 

I was blocked by the son of Hezbollah member who mocked one of the hostages on her appearance, people in NYC were writing signs that said things like kill the hostages, the hostages aren't coming home and I saw some pro Palestine people claiming they're psyops or accusing taking down hostages posters as not wanting to see propaganda, or the hostages aren't here are they. Ironically enough the same person posted a video criticizing a women working at a college campus taking down posters of Gazans which I thought was pretty funny

20) boycotting anything related to Israel regardless if it comes from Israel

people boycotting Starbucks when it's not in Israel or just boycotting or denouncing celebs who dared to say something like I want a 2ss, October 7th was terrible, what Israel is doing to Gaza is terrible as being a zionist or some Israel shill. If you want to boycott targeted boycotts are the way to go don't just boycott everything and please don't just boycott stuff because you heard it has ties to Israel when it doesn't. Another ridiculous incident I saw was when singer Bon Iver who donated to the Palestinian Children's Relief Fund was criticized for donating to Standing Together a joint Israeli- Palestinian pro peace, anti war org in Israel and a lot of fans attacked him because they saw Israeli and freaked out even though this org stopped far right settlers from attacking the aid trucks to the point where they stopped showing up it's a good org

21) having unrealistic expectations from anti war Israelis

I saw extreme pro Palestine voices criticizing Israelis for protesting with complaints about them waving Israeli flags around, not calling for Israel to be dismantled, and not leaving Israel. When there's orgs like Standing Together who actually did something good, people who are pro Palestine saw Israeli mentioned and assumed it was bad, even people with watermelon emojis were condemning those criticizing the org by saying the org was doing great work. It seems like Israelis can never protest in a way that will make some people in the Pro Palestine crowd happy",pro,anti,

A new Knesset bill is seeking to expand restrictions on who can run in elections. The opposition says it will entrench the right-wing governments power, while Palestinian citizens of Israel fear they will lose their political representation.

The bill was introduced by Likud MK and essentially expands the Knesset’s ability to disqualify candidate, largely on grounds of supporting terrorism. Now, the original Knesset bill already has this ability in question but the bill expands it. What Palestinian Citizens of Israel fear is that the bill, combined with Israel’s right wing government, will allow the Government Knesset members to arbitrarily pick and choose who can run in the elections and, given the community often protests against the occupation of the West Bank and against the current war in Gaza, Government Knesset members will bar such opposition from Knesset representation.

The Knesset has a number of different bills that are currently being discussed of course, but this one is consequential because… it could remove 20 percent of Israel’s population from having Knesset representation. Moreover, for Israeli Jews who also have been protesting the occupation of the West Bank and the war in Gaza, the government could also use the legislation against them. And that’s not to mention that the bill would also diminish the ability of the Supreme Court to have oversight the barring of candidates, and political lists, which have been attempted before but challenged. Ultimately, it could really concentrate power in the hands of the government and governing parties, and entrench the current political discourse in the country.

This hasn’t really been picked up in the Western press, although this piece of legislation, and others, have most certainly been discussed in the Israeli Hebrew and English language press. It is of course, an important and consequential piece of legislation.",anti,pro,

When asked, in the context of the rescue operation to free four Israeli hostages in June, which resulted in the killing of over 270 Palestinians, “How do you identify who is a terrorist? he answered: ""We attacked on the side of the street to drive civilians away, and whoever did not flee, even if he was unarmed, as far as we were concerned, was a terrorist.

Israel literally trains for this. Every able man or woman spends a mandatory two years in the militia training for this moment.

Hamas has used the Palestinian people through Iranian influence to be their human shield.  I feel badly for the Palestinian people as well. But Hamas, a terrorist group, will not give up it's leaders and members. They continue to hide in Gaza, hence the Israeli ground invasion. They let the Palestinian people, who even before this strike upon Israel, were not doing  well, hang out to dry and the world blames Israel. I won't even go into how this is already spreading to strategic U.S. bases in the Mediterranean. When our soldiers are being killed, Americans will feel however they feel then.

I proudly stand with Israel. I am a Jew, because I was born a Jew. Although there are a couple converts in the family. This might be genocide to the rest of the world, even with 4 day cease fire, but for me, if Hamas surrendered like they expect Israel to do, there would be no war. It's too bad that Hamas via Iran infiltrated the Palestinians and involved them in this horrific atrocity, thinking they would win. There is no peace in the Middle East.

Every night since 9 Oct 2023 Pope Francis called the Gaza parish to pray for and check in on them.    
    
In his last public appearance before his death, Pope Francis addressed Easter Sunday Mass where he repeated the call for a ceasefire in Gaza.    
    
I think Catholics, Christians, and non-Christians alike can appreciate this message.    
    
Rest in Peace Pope Francis 🕊️

1lcnu5p,2025-06-16,IsraelPalestine,"I have sympathy for the Palestinians, I just don't like the pro-Palestine movement Antisemitism is rampant where I come from. Thus the Holocaust has always haunted me, partially because our societies were complicit, but also because I grew up around antisemites in Eastern-Europe.

It is not the fault of the Palestinians. Moreover, I think it's outrageous and disgusting that Netanyahu even tried to pin the Holocaust on the Arabs, suggesting that they advised Hitler on the final solution. Even if it was true (it is not), European antisemitism and ancient hatred between religious groups is not the same. The former was not only rooted in the old prejudice of Christians against Jews, but also racialised Jews. Racialisation of Jews (and others) only became rampant after the acceleration of pseudo-rationalisation rooted in the Enlightment and romantic anticapitalism. 

So as you can tell, I am very allergic to antisemitism, despite not being a Jew. I even became an atheist largely because I couldn't accept the antisemitism of the protestant church. 

When I see images of Palestine, of course I am outraged. Of course, I have a heart, I can see that this is wrong, that this shouldn't happen to anyone. It is also not that difficult to see that Netanyahu doesn't even care about the Jews, let alone Palestinians. But when I see comments like ""we should send an apology to Germany"" or even ""from the river to the sea""... Do you not want to be convincing? Isn't this what the israeli government wants? To show to the israelis ""look, everybody hates you, except your government that will protect you""? Isn't this why israeli propaganda works?

I've seen Norman Finkelstein saying that he no longer cares about antisemitism, because there are bigger victims today everywhere than Jews. I disagree. I don't think the ""Holocaust industry"" achieved anything. And I fully believe the pro-Palestine movement attracts real antisemites too.",pro,neutral,

1ndujse,2025-09-11,IsraelPalestine,"Just as many Jews as Palestinian Arabs died in the ""Nakbe"" I see a lot of Pro-Palestinians asking like the Nabke was some sort of Jewish aggression, where Jews mass killed Palestinians, who simply ... cowered? I guess?

But it's the other way around. Palestinian Arabs were the ones who started the war — by murdering civilians, by the way, with Arab mobs invading the Jewish neighborhood of Mea Shearim in Jerusalem on Dec. 2, 1947 and murdering Jewish civilians there.

Once the war got underway, about 6,000 of each died in the war (estimates go lower and higher for both, that's the average). And by the way, this was 1% of the Jewish population at the time, the same percentage of Palestinians that have died in this current war. So if you think this current 2025 war is a genocide, then you must agree that Palestinian Arabs were the ones who genocided Jews in the Nakbe. Meanwhile, a much smaller percentage of Palestinians died.

Palestinians also besieged Jerusalem, starving 100,000 Jews (most were malnourished but survived thankfully) and displaced about the same number. More Palestinians were displaced not because Israeli troops went around displacing them, but because Arabs wanted to escape a warzone and they had places they could flee to, such as Jordan, since they were surrounded by Arab countries. Jews civilians had nowhere to escape to.

Same with civilian massacres. Pro-Palestinians often bring up Deir Yassin while ignoring the far larger number of time Arabs massacred entire Jewish villages.

It's ridiculous to see this war as some sort of act of evil Jewish aggression and see Palestinian Arabs as innocents, given that Palestinians started the war and killed just as much.",pro,neutral,

The Armenian genocide costed 1 million lives in a year. These happened over a larger territorial holdings than the strip.  By ww1 arms in one case.  In rifles and machete like meele weapons in another. I have disputed the idea of genocide since this chaos started.  To be called all sorts of names. I don't mind.  We're we to look at the total fatalities as a percentage of population i don't even think it would qualify. 


The fatalities in Gaza are horrible and a condemnation on all ppl. However they seem more in line to the destruction of total war. My title of this is half ironic. The allegations of genocide has not ended. Yet to a casual observer there is no grounds to that charge. Appearing more in line to the use the alarmist propaganda.  Than an actual genocidal plot. A nation such as Israel to have set out to commit genocide and still not be done with it. Seems to a spurious charge. They can destroy 5 armies across all it's fronts in 6 days. But cannot do this????  


I genually don't understand how this qualifies as genocide? And to my readings it seems like somewhere we conflated the indiscriminate bombings with acts of genocide and called it as such. 

Look. I genuinely believe the People of the strip got a very rotten end of the stick. Suffering from Israel's harsh retribution to the plots of Hamas. And suffering Hamas stupid leadership that knows an end to fighting means an end to their mandate.  I don't know how much Gazans support Hamas. Prior discussions with ppl attempted to separate the identities of GAZA and HAMAs and calling Hamas puppets of Israel. I found those charge spurious and biased given the apparent unwillingness to think Israeli ppls as different from the government or IDF showing bias in that regard. 

Anyway. What are the evidentiary proof of a genocide in Gaza?

1bx4qau,2024-04-06,IsraelPalestine,"Israel-Palestine 2050 what will the region look like in 2050? will there be a two-state solution? I'm looking at the trends, and this is what I see: 

first, demographic data, birth rates, and cultural trends point towards the Israeli population becoming less European and less liberal. with time, it will become an ultra Orthodox state, jewish, but similar to Iran or Saudi Arabia as a theocracy, unrecognizable as a western democracy. at some point along this road, there will be a greater disconnect from Jews in the US and Western Europe, and Israeli will become one of the boys, one of the numerous Arab states quarrelling with other Arab states, scheming against each other, hatching alliances, this may actually help with its long-term survival. another way to say this is that Israel will assimilate into the larger culture of the Middle East and Arab world, which is marked by lack of democracy, religious extremism, and internecine warfare.


second, the genocide Israel is committing in Gaza will create an entire generation of Palestinians and Arabs that will hate Israel, and for legitimate reasons. likewise, any sympathy Israel and Jews across the world have received because of their treatment during the Holocaust will diminish as people begin to see Israelis as capable of committing the same types of atrocities as the Germans. this will be a major liability. Israel may become a pariah State like South Africa due to its apartheid-like treatment of Arabs within its borders. or the West (hypocritical) will pretend to hold its nose and deal with Israel much like it does with other states in the region with less than stellar human rights records.

third, during the ensuing decades, settlements on the west bank will continue to expand until all the Arabs on the West Bank are displaced and Israeli settlers occupy the entire West bank. something similar will happen in Gaza as Israel slowly encroaches from the north. with most Arabs removed from West Bank and Gaza or living there but without land rights, Israelis will begin to turn on each other. they're already doing that, but without these two flashpoints within its aspirational borders, this will escalate.

4th, the moral character of the nation will continue to deteriorate. it started off bad with the ethnic cleansing of Arabs, but the routine violation of international law on the West Bank, now the genocide in gaza, torture of prisoners, the rapes and sexual humiliations of Arabs, the looting, will further corrode Judaism in israel. the immorality tarnishes a people and has reverberations through multiple subsequent generations. again, it will become more like other Arab states. Jews from around the world who have these inclinations will move to israel, while Israelis who see the moral sickness in their country will emigrate. this is happening right now in slow motion. 

fifth, demographics will also increase the size of Israel's Arab neighbors making the country more susceptible to being overrun again especially as Western support wanes. Population projections for 2050 are Egypt at 147 million, Israel at 15 million, turkey at 103 million, and Iran at 99 million. the projection for the Palestinian territories is 10 million, but considering that Israel will continue to push Palestinians off of their land, this population will be either in Jordan or Egypt or incorporated into Israel proper. being the little kid on the block, Israel may use it smarts to form alliances and play one Arab State off against another.

six, democracy will decrease. it is happening now. netanyahu almost became a dictator. it was a close call. the next time he or someone like him will be successful, and then Israel becomes like turkey or Syria or egypt.",anti,pro,

1kvp7oz,2025-05-26,IsraelPalestine,"IDF is full of terrorists What’s happening in Gaza and the West Bank is just awful and heartbreaking. Entire families are being wiped out, children buried under rubble, homes and hospitals turned to dust — and it keeps happening. Yet no one bats an eye. It’s like the world has become numb, like it's somehow normal that dozens of Palestinians are murdered every single day. Every airstrike, every sniper shot, every demolished home is treated like a statistic instead of a human life lost. Israel claims it’s acting in self-defense, but how do you justify bombing refugee camps, targeting schools, or cutting off food, water, electricity, and medical aid to an entire population? This isn’t defense. It’s collective punishment. It’s apartheid. It’s a war on civilians.

Human rights organizations around the world — Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, UN investigators — have all said it loud and clear: these are war crimes. And this didn’t start on October 7. This is the result of decades of violence, dehumanization, and occupation. In 1948, over 700,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed during the Nakba when Israel was established on stolen land. Since then, generations have lived under military rule, siege, checkpoints, blockades, and bombs.

This is not a conflict between two equal sides. One side has one of the most powerful militaries in the world. The other is fighting to survive. Demanding an end to this horror is not hate, it’s humanity. It's about justice, dignity, and freedom for a people who have been denied all three for far too long.

1kf7w30,2025-05-05,IsraelPalestine,"Is there really widescale starvation in Gaza? 
So I want to preface this with:

This is meant in good faith. In no way do I want to minimize any person's suffering, but there definitely is a lot of propaganda regarding this conflict and I believe that propaganda harms everyone more than it helps. In fact, the only ones benefiting from this propaganda war is Hamas. 

My point is this:

I saw an Instagram account of a restaurant in Gaza that seems to be operational - they are quite active on Instagram. This got me thinking. How can restaurants operate if there is no food available? Or is there an obvious explanation for this? Can it be that they are far removed from the war torn areas? Is the Instagram account fake? Or is there another explanation for this? 

They post regularly and the last post was yesterday. 

If you look at the food they are posting on the Instagram account, it's clear that it is quite decadent, tasty food. I doubt that this can be from remaining stockpiles because certain food types do spoil quickly, but maybe I am wrong?

I don't doubt that the people are suffering, but at least, from an outside perspective, it does seem that there are at least a few restaurants that have good a decent supply of foods. 

And if this is the case that there is not a widespread famine in Gaza, why do people emphatically still claim that there is? 

I don't think that there is starvation in Gaza, or at least not widespread starvation. Nor do I think that there is an active, deliberate Genocide happening. 

Anyone have any opinion regarding this?

1ah6jnu,2024-02-02,IsraelPalestine,"How to counter the misinformation about Israel-Hamas war: the guide Hey all,

do you get very confused and even angry when you read media coverage and social media posts and can’t tell if what you are looking at can be taken at face value? Although, ultimately, it is quite impossible to always be able to figure out how true what you look at it, there are certain techniques and rules that every journalist (like myself) or researcher (like myself during my time in academia) who work in good faith use to bring the chance of being misinformed down significantly. I organized some techniques in a little guide for those who are interested.

Before you read the rules, I urge you to sit with one question: emotionally, is it more important for you to stay in good grace with your community (Zionists and anti-Zionists on this thread specifically), or is it more important for you to critically think and learn the truth that can make you more confused and uncertain, while simultaneously helping you to be a better person and better serve your community in a long run? Are you more into soothing your fear and anger with information attained in bad faith, or do you wish to build knowledge that will bring nuances and even contradictions into your thinking about the Israel-Hamas war, but will make your thinking more just?

If it’s the former, this post might not be for you. I do not blame people who rally on bigotry or just prefer to ignore things that contradict what they already believe. It is indeed hard, especially if you feel you are being unjustly attacked. I feel for you very much, but you aren’t serious participants of the public discourse who are ready for solutions for yourself or in general.

That being said, here is how I urge you to read the news.

**0.** Don't just skim the coverage, don’t read just one source and definitely don't read just the headlines and assume what you see is truthful. Headers are clickbaits, and very often they leave important nuances out for the sake of bringing traffic.

Example: Russian neoliberal media Meduza published an article on Oct 25 (https://meduza.io/feature/2023/10/25/ya-proshla-cherez-ad) with a header *""I went through hell"": What the Israeli hostage, who was captured by Hamas terrorists, revealed. She was released two weeks after being kidnapped.""*

What we read in the body of the article is the hostage referred to kidnapping itself as hell, which is a horrid act of violence against innocent Israeli civilians, but we also see this quote from the lady’s press conference:

`""They treated us gently, providing everything we needed,"" she said, responding to the question of why she tried to shake hands with the militant right after her release. ""They were very generous to us, very kind. They kept us clean. They took care of every detail. There are many women there; they know about feminine hygiene, and they took care of everything,"" Lifshitz recounted.""`

No matter your opinion, maybe you think this particular woman is just a bonkers old lady with dementia, the “I went through hell” is not ultimately a summary of her reconstruction of what happened to her, it is a part of her experience. Keep your opinions about hamas, but admit this victim's full testimony into your thinking process. Undertones of what we gather about the attack and hostages matter. They do not contradict everything else you might know about the conditions of hostages, they provide you with a fuller picture, and you’ll build on this overtime.

**1.** If it’s a social media post, check the media cited. If none are, and you can't google any serious media outlet covering it, move on, don't use it in your arguments and don't repost, even if emotionally it is very appealing and feeds your beliefs. Yes, many large media conglomerates report in bad faith here and there, but relying on unverifiable information instead isn’t your solution for that. Instead, with a grain of salt, rely on fact-checking websites like Snopes. Although not perfect, Snopes collects links on many instances that can be further studied and does not provide any opinions of their contributors. I wish more serious fact-checkers did more work on Israel-Hamas war, like my favorite Belingcat, but it's not happening fast enough. However, I do highly recommend checking how Belingcat works (it's the only source I trust almost fully because they work with data, not with people) and seeing their scarce investigations.

**Examples:** Jabalia refugee camp bombing Belingcat fact-check. [https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/10/31/confirming-a-strike-on-jabalia-refugee-camp-as-israeli-forces-approach-gaza-city/](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2023/10/31/confirming-a-strike-on-jabalia-refugee-camp-as-israeli-forces-approach-gaza-city/)

Palestinian blooded dolls sold in Israel fact check. [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/palestinian-baby-dolls-israel/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/palestinian-baby-dolls-israel/)

**2.**  If the media looks like a blog, an opinion website, or the whole feed is similar to what you've just seen, move on, these aren’t serious sources of factual knowledge. Additionally, google for any controversies about the media and always check who runs the media.

**Examples:** Both Al Jazeera and The Times of Israel were founded by billionaires (Qatari Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa and Jewish American billionaire and lobbyist Seth Klarman), and you should always keep in mind that even though both of these media report a lot of truthful information, the people who pay salaries have personal agendas. You should always cross-reference from media like this, even if you personally prefer one or another.

3. If it is generally big, respected (by you or by any large group of people) media, see if other big guns posted similar information. If none, keep your doubt.

**Example:** Al Jazeera first published the report of the IDF leaving premature babies in a Palestinian hospital on the beds, who consequently starved to death and started decomposing. In the beginning, Al Jazeera was the only big media source reporting on it, so, while being extremely disturbed by this, I couldn't rely on this information without a doubt. A couple of weeks later, CNN, NBC, Daily Mail, and The Mirror all picked the story up which made it convincing enough for me (and the dread settled in my heart). These media are all run by people with different political agendas (although it's always a Venn diagram) and lean in different directions about the war, so checks out.

**4.** See the sources cited in the article. If there are only regular people, although might be truthful, it is not good enough, unless a lot of people say the same thing. Instead, look for police department involvement, government officials, actual victims, transparent non-profits and their spokespeople, speakers with expertise in the field, and then you can start paying attention. Additionally, hold your horses and give experts time to investigate. Don't feed into public assumptions before that, it's dangerous and it creates further divide that we must be very mindful of.

**Example:** A bomb dropped on Al-Shifa hospital in mid-November that was widely assumed by the pro-Palestinian public to come from Israel almost instantly after the release. However, it would be impossible to say what was actually true before experts went on the ground and assessed. Indeed, later on, it was proven to be a hamas missile misfired.

**5.** If it is a video from a public place with a lot of people, especially at protest, look for more videos. People record them all the time, everywhere, and especially in situations like this. If there's a video of an atrocity from a huge protest, for example, but it's the only one, there's a high chance that the media is altered.

**Example:** ""Gas the Jews"" at the Australian protest that is currently widely used as a prove of vicious antisemitism. There is only one video circulated on that, and it is published by a conservative Jewish group AJA. There are experts who analyzed the video and concluded the sound was altered. On top of that, there are no other videos like that from the said protest. The investigation was conducted by the police (https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/12/13/viral-footage-gas-the-jews-police-factcheckers-unverified/), and it turns out the protests yelled ""f-ck the Jews"", which is still pretty nasty but is not an incitement of genocide.

There are a lot of examples of antisemitic crimes and hate speech that do check out, so to make a valid point about the rise of antisemitism, you don’t need to use false information at all. The facts are there for you. That goes to the rise of Arabophobia as well.

**6.** All that being said, do incorporate real people’s accounts into your judgment and evaluate what you know with them in mind.

**Example:** Instagram page @ eye.on.palestine. The videos dropping there are, without a doubt, horrific. Although this post isn’t for me making my personal stance clear, Zionists, I do urge you to watch them, not to change your views about who is to blame for all of this, but to exercise your empathy muscle towards people who were unlucky to be born in Gaza.

There are three things to say about accounts like eye.on.palestine

*Firstly*, it's just too many accounts of suffering for all of them to be staged. They publish children mourning their siblings, mothers crying in anguish about their killed kids, man carrying unconscious children to hospitals, and doctors performing surgeries under phone flashlights, daily. It is happening, and it is happening to real people with real lives and real bodies.

*Secondly*, you know that already but it’s worth mentioning that hamas officials loooooove Instagram accounts like this and actively rely on them to promote their agenda. However, it doesn't mean everything published on them isn't true and we need to loose sight of the humanity of people we see on these pages. Same for pro-Israeli media. The accounts of released hostages are horrific and we mustn't look away from them, but they do serve people who personally can't give lesser f-cks about the struggles of Israeli hostages.

*Thirdly*, if you can, run some of them by people who might know. For instance, I have a brother, ex-IDF, who lives in Be'er Shiva. I do not live in Israel, and the war is way more real and palpable for him than it is for me. A video of an IDF soldier harassing a teen in the West Bank was dropped by the account and I shared it with my brother (with whom I disagree on many accounts in regards of this s-show, but whom I love and empathize with) and told him ""If I was humiliated like this, or my kids were, I probably would end up building bombs from sticks and s-it myself"". He told me, that sometimes, and more often these days, Palestinian men would send their kids to throw stones at the IDF soldiers, and eventually the army personnel would just have enough and go in for some disciplining. At this point, a person with a camera appears and starts recording, the video is published, and everyone is shocked. I personally believe it doesn't make the IDF look any better, but this isn’t a point made here. The point is his reply gave the nuance I will be mindful of when watching videos like this,  and nuance is more important than ever.

**7.** It's worth saying that all of this will never 100% eliminate the chance the information you believe to be true is actually false. That's why it is important to not rely on anecdotical evidence, including instances from your personal life, to create a full picture of what’s happening in your head. Just build on what you see over time, piece by piece, and conclude on the whole situation when you are comfortable with the amount of true-ish things you see. It’s a lot of work, and that's the best you can do.

**8.** Bonus: just read a freaking book or two. That’ll help.",neutral,neutral,

1jakou7,2025-03-13,IsraelPalestine,"Israel Land theft in West Bank and Syria is Greater Israel project All of us the entire world says Stealing is Wrong. And Israel is no Exception.

reasons behind Israel's breaches of global rules remain unclear. The destruction of Palestinian homes in the West Bank is ongoing. This creates a constant crisis. Illegal settlements keep growing. This violates past deals and creates tension.

Israel's military actions in Syria also cause worry. They say it's to protect the Druze people. But this feels like an excuse to invade. Imagine if another country invaded the U.S. Their stated reason? To protect a specific group from the U.S. government. Global law forbids such actions. No country can invade another simply to protect a group.

There's no clear answer for why Israel breaks international law. The destruction of Palestinian homes in the West Bank continues. Illegal settlements keep expanding, violating established agreements.

Israel's actions against Syria also raise concerns. The stated reason was to protect the Druze population. This justification feels like a pretext for invasion. Imagine another country invading the United States. The reason? To protect a specific group against the U.S. government. International law does not allow such interference.

Claiming to protect a group doesn't justify violating another nation's sovereignty. This situation appears linked to the Greater Israel Project. Expanding territory beyond recognized borders is happening. Building settlements in the West Bank breaks international law. It also violates the laws governing the West Bank itself. How can Israel's supporters justify these actions?

1b7g90i,2024-03-05,Palestine,"Neo-nazis and white supremacists are infiltrating pro-Palestine discourse on X to spread old school antisemitic conspiracies to larger audiences. If you support Palestine and want the movement to have mainstream credibility in the West, you need to push back on this Several prominent 'Pro-Palestine' and Anti-Zionist accounts generating tons of engagement and traffic on Elon Musk's X appear to be right wing white nationalists and neo-nazis in disguise. What they'll do is sell the situation in Gaza or general Palestinian cause and talk about fighting the genocide but begin to subtly infuse age-old stereotypes about Jews with the state of Israel as a whole (using Palestinian children's blood in rituals aka the Medieval Blood Libel, seeking to establish a ""New World Order"" etc). They'll then gradually transition to attacking Jews as a group mixed in with posts covering events in Gaza, selling an image of how ""The Jews"" as a singular vicious entity are slaughtering the Palestinians and how they have full impunity to do so because they control every government and institution in the West (a la classic Nazi propaganda). Major examples of this include:

* Jackson Hinkle
* Jake Shields
* Ryan Dawson
* Sam Parker

Others such as several ""Anti Zionist Defense League"" type accounts, some of which bought official organization checkmarks, went too far on the 'transitioning to attacking Jews themselves' part and their profiles suddenly turned into outright praising Hitler, posting his speeches and talking about how Gaza shows why Hitler did what he did and the need for his vision of the world again. Those ones got banned, but the more 'professional' ones such as the others quoted above remain.

Several have been re-posted on prominent left wing and pro-Palestine spaces both on this site and others in recent months, although its generally been their pro-Palestine stuff or anti-Zionist critiques with the posters seemingly unaware of who they really are underneath. But this is exactly how they're spreading. 

I understand the frustration and feeling of not being heard amidst the Israeli attack on Gaza. Even the desire to lash out. But the Palestinian movement is already struggling for mainstream recognition and credibility in the countries that could stop it, becoming even loosely affiliated with white supremacists and nazis will certainly not aid the cause and if anything could easily damage the Palestinians' image of indigenous people fighting for their land. 

Furthermore, numerous parts of the pro-Israel side are already alleging association of the pro-Palestine movement with nazi elements. An explicit repudiation of it, and conscious cleaning up of any such attempted infiltrations out of the movement (perhaps publicly, so neutrals can see) will only serve to benefit and legitimize the cause in the very places it needs mainstream support the most.",pro,anti,
1jc8utw,2025-03-16,Palestine,"Instead of giving Palestine to Israel, let's give them Nevada I'm serious. 86% of Nevada is uninhabited desert land with a few ghost towns dotting the interstate here and there. The ghost towns, once bustling communities sustained by the state's mining industry, began to shrink as the mining boom dried up in the first half of the 20th century. Ultimately, the towns were mostly abandoned and remain so to this day. What's left of them is sustained by gimmicky motel/casinos which host highway drifters for a night or two as they pass through on their way to somewhere else. The old buildings, relics from the late 19th century, are crumbling where they stand, and absolutely no one cares. 

But the vast majority of the state is just open, empty, mountainous desert terrain completely bereft of human life. This land is managed by the federal government. Why not give this portion of the state to Israel? It is much larger than the portion of Palestine they're currently squatting on, and relocating them to Nevada would cost us far less in the long run than sustaining the current arrangement which is creating so much misery and trouble. Plus it would spark an economic revival in parts of Nevada that have been dead and virtually abandoned for almost a century. 

If Israel is so frightened of its neighbors, let them move to Nevada. Who cares? No one will bother them in Nevada, and they can establish a partner government with the United States just like the American tribes do, including my own.

17u08ra,2023-11-13,IsraelPalestine,"Jihad, War, or Terrorism? Serious question here… Okay. First off, I’m not Muslim. But after some brief reading from scholarly sources; Jihad literally means “struggle”. But there are different forms of Jihad also referred to as “Pilars” of Jihad. 1 is physical, another is against satan, and the third against lust. Formal physical Jihad needs to be declared by a religious leader(s) and comes in two general forms, defensive and offensive and each of those has specific rules regarding how they are supposed to be fought/defended. The offensive type is often preemptive in nature but can’t be used to gain territory and can’t be used in offense to Allah. Now, I have no idea if the Oct7th attack was actually a declared act of Jihad by a religious leader… 

My question is; was the Oct7th offensive into Israel an act of war? Was there a declaration of war? If so, wouldn’t it just be fought as a war? And either Israel or Palestine could just surrender if they didn’t want to continue a war? Then after either side surrendered some sort of treaty would be made to determine spoils for the victor, restitution from the vanquished, and/or what type of government the vanquish party would be allowed to institute? Just like most wars that have been fought for the last 7000 years?

step 3, Ukraine moves every single himars to the sumary region as well (needed for later)

step 4 right at midnight, ukraines jam all russian communications, websites,  cell, radio, tv networks, 1 massive cyber attack to play the wings of hussar song on repeat.

step 5 as this is happening polish jets begin bombing every single possible military position they pre mapped, including air defences in moscow.

step 6 as the wings of kussar begin terrorizing russia, running full steam ahead towards moscow destroying everything in their path, ukraines in kursk join the rush with all the himars in tow along with other vehicles.

19de7yg,2024-01-23,Palestine,"Should Hamas/Gaza really seek a ceasefire with Israel at this time? If continuing the war would harm Israel more than it does Palestine, then seeking a ceasefire would be a bad idea. To me, that seems to be the case. According to Hamas, over 1600 Israeli troops have been killed since the start of the ground invasion and around 15% of Israel's armored vehicles have been destroyed or captured. Moreover, Israel's pre-war stockpiles of things like artillery shells are probably completely depleted, leading to their campaign's stagnation, and they're having to rely on the West for resupply. Continuing the war would severely weaken Israel's military strength relative to other Arab nations and could make countries like Egypt, Syria, and Iran more likely to fight them directly.

If we were only talking about Israel and Palestine here, this would make sense. However, the United States continues to support Israel both economically and militarily. As long as the US is willing to support Israel, they could continue the war indefinitely without considerably reducing their military capabilities. Even with the US in mind though, continuing the war may be in Palestine's best interest. Groups like the Houthis, Hezbollah, and Islamic Resistance of Iraq will continue to attack US targets in response to America's support for Israel. If these attacks continue (which they almost certainly will), this leaves the US with a choice; either withdraw its support or eventually be drawn into another war in the Middle East, most likely with Iran. In either case, the US's ability to support Israel will be reduced in the short-term. And depending on how long that hypothetical war lasts, how many resources the US has to commit to it, and political attitudes towards pro-US/Israeli governments in the Middle East, this could decrease America's ability to project power in the Middle East long-term.

Once Israel runs out of resources and political will to fight, then the Palestinians can extract concessions from them such as an end to the blockade. All of this assumes that the Palestinians can continue to fight Israel at their current intensity for probably another year or more and continuing the war will no doubt result in tens of thousands of additional Palestinians dead. However, it may be in Palestine's best interest long-term to do so. What do you guys think?",anti,pro,

ICC Top Prosecutor Was Preparing Arrest Warrants for Far-Right Israeli Politicians (Paywall) https://www.wsj.com/world/middle-east/icc-israel-politician-warrants-91d24404 

International Criminal Court (ICC) chief prosecutor Karim Khan was readying to request arrest warrants for Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir before going on leave amid a sexual misconduct probe. 

According Wall Street Journal, which cites current and former International Criminal Court officials, the chief prosecutor was building a case against Smotrich and Ben-Gvir over their roles in promoting Jewish settlements in the West Bank. Interesting, ICC was only pursuing Smotrich and Ben-Gvir in matters relating to West Bank and nothing to do with Gaza and his speeches relating to the Palestinians in Gaza. Does it mean ICC think Smotrich and Ben-Gvir didnt do anything wrong with regards to Gaza ?  or does the ICC not have enough evidence relating Gaza or not confidence enough in the case to seek for arrest warrants of Smotrich and Ben-Gvir? 

I really hope Khan’s deputies will continue to move forward with the case against the two far-right Israeli ministers and request for the arrest warrants.

Through this conflict, I have gone from viewing Israel as a country championing western values in the middle east, worthy of our tax dollars, to understanding it for what it really is:  An ethno-supremacist colony intent on subverting the region through military means and against all humanitarian convention.

It is those people who founded it, who necessarily struck the first blow.  True compassion would have been for the Europeans who committed the atrocities, to deliver them some of *their* land.  In fact, this notion was debated before settling on Israel. So, this founding principle characterizes the start of an unjustified, slow-motion ethnic cleansing.  Empirically an apartheid state that seeks to create a Jewish majority by any means - and not the democracy with Western values I was sold.

This discrimination is a necessary component of Zionism - to displace people of their lives and land based on historical readings of holy texts and ancient history.  No example of western democracy's natural and property rights available to the native arabs.  Any agnostic observer can recall the United Nations voting record, where it is essentially the United States and Israel Vs the world.  The US vote has singularly protected Israel from binding resolutions that would undo their settler-colonial actions.  The PLO and PA proved fallible, but a deep understanding of the historical record reveals recurring poison pills were inserted into peace deals, with Hamas funded by Israel to undermine said authority of the more moderate- according to Norm Finkelstein.  Maintaining this violent status quo benefits Israel alone- see Noam Chomsky.

There exists in most people in Israel, a kind of supremacy - religiously and ethnically rooted, that rationalizes their aspirations.   If you listen to any interview of the locals, they speak about Arabs in those terms.  See Abby Martin's latest youtube upload.   I listen to Israelis speak of being gifted the land by God, and of course the tale of being the Chosen People.  That it manifests as an apartheid state, should come as no surprise.  Reminder that apartheid states are considered a crime against humanity under International Law.

And so the native peoples of that land are victims of a most public and barbaric settler-colonialist front.  One whose AI and air bombing campaigns recall ""A report on The Banality of Evil"" by Hannah Arendt.  Palestinians are now enduring the most vicious attacks (vicariously) from a world superpower, put simply for existing in a land someone else wants.

Anyone in the West who dare speak out and challenge the predominate pro-Israeli narrative, is de-platformed, jailed, or labeled anti-semitic/racist.  United States citizens are now having their rights curtailed because of overt critique of a foreign government.  As a believer in the sanctity of our Constitution, this alarms me greatly. ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble..""  .  There exists a bellicose ethno-favoritism, that it has metastasized and devoured our very own constitutional principles and priorities.  One needn't look further than the riotous applause the Israeli Prime Minister received for giving a political speech filled with egregious lies.  The Hague would like to see this man, but instead we received him in the People's House.

I am not here to defend Hamas, or any violence.  I condemn all violence.  Yet, the truth matters.  The truth is that, October 7th did not happen as we were told.  Two babies died as a result of that attack, and there is no evidence of the 40 (beheadings) as was reported.  Further, the sexual crimes claimed were not proven per Israeli reporting and a United Nations investigation.  The truth is many of the people reported as killed on that day, were killed by the IDF, as reported by Israeli journalists.  The truth is that, the media at the time worked overtime to push Israeli narratives, without first investigating claims.  This proved to benefit the pro-war campaign as it serves to dehumanize Hamas.

Israel seems to believe that what it says can lay cover for what it does.  The **most moral army in the world** would never use their enemy as human shields.  Would never knowingly bomb schools, hospitals, homes, journalists, aid workers, refugee encampments.   Would not trivialize their war crimes by posting them to social media.  Would not order the assassination of its own people for political gain.  Would not torture their political prisoners.  This is no longer a defensive campaign, they are making a military point on the lives of the destitute - Israel is establishing deterrence supremacy, International Law and geneva conventions be damned.  If this war is not collective punishment, I don't know what is.

**Israel has no formal treaty with the US**.  You would be hard pressed to present a geopolitical benefit of our alliance, other than vague ""intelligence"" operations.  In fact, one could easily argue that their intelligence has goaded us into conflict, against our national interest.  Benjamin Netanyahu stood before Congress and sold us on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.   Who will atone for this misdirection?  How can we ever progress if we cannot have an honest conversation about real world outcomes of this relationship?  What is the World to think when we put the interests of one state, ahead of the entirety of it?

I am neither Jewish, nor Christian, nor Arab.  Reddit will be proud to know, I have 4 year degree in Political Science/IA and in that way could claim expertise.  I do not.

I simply claim to feel for a people historically wronged, and my country which is being led down the primrose path.

""It's right there for all to see and it feels like something out of a science fiction film. This is the wall. From the other side, from inside this place, for instance, the Aida \[West Bank\] refugee camp in the district of Bethlehem, it doesn't feel like anything other than what it is: a prison."" -Anthony Bourdain, 2013 Parts Unknown CNN",anti,pro,

1bza17t,2024-04-08,IsraelPalestine,"Eliminating Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, etc. When it comes to Israel eliminating Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - Quds Force, and other terrorist groups they need to do better at informing the populace on the targets.

  
For example:

  
We know some very influential targets have been eliminated in the current conflict.  
Targets such as:  Marwan Issa, Ayman Nofal, Mohammad Reza Zahedi, and others.

  
It is common to hear other names that are high value targets such as:  Mohammed Deif, etc.

  
Israel needs to educate the populace and the world further on the individuals involved in these organizations.  Individuals who are responsible for Palestinian domestic weapons production.  The individuals who are involved with transporting weapons from Iran into Palestine and Lebanon.

  
The individuals involved in creating weapon systems inside of Palestine such as Short Range Artillery Rockets and Mortars that are used with the intention to indiscriminately murder as many Israel citizens as possible - in particular Jews.  
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps - Quds Force who have the specific interest to murder as many Jews and frankly Sunni Muslims as possible in order to establish a stronger and stronger Shia Muslim influence in that region but also world wide.

  
Much as Hamas treats their own people as readily disposable and profits from their suffering and death so does Iran use Hamas as readily disposable and profits from their suffering and death.

  
Israel needs to show the statements and larger speeches of certain individuals as well as documenting their actions not just against Israel and in specific Jews/Christians/Agnostics/Atheists/Eastern Religions/In general secular individuals (All those that Islamic terrorist groups believe should not exist) but against their own people (Such as the beatings, torture, and murder of their own people that live differently or believe differently than Islamic terror groups want them to).

  
This way when an individual is killed many will say ""Oh that was so and so.  The individual who was involved in the disappearance of an LGBT individual."", ""Oh that is so and so.  The individual who spoke about Christians and Jews and the West needing to be purged from existence."", ""Oh that is so and so.  The individual responsible for building explosives that shoot out nails and other shrapnel to maim and disfigure as many victim as possible with the intention of making their lives as horrific as possible if they were not killed outright.""

  
Other nations have educated their populace and the world in regards to ISIS, Al Qaeda, and other Islamic terrorist groups and the specific individuals involved at certain levels of the organization.

  
For example when Israel goes into Rafah they can speak about the certain targets who are hiding in that area and amongst civilians.  They can speak about the Hamas battalions for that area and what they have all been responsible for in regards to actions against Israel as well as their own people.",pro,anti,

This sub is great, And also quite balanced, that is, there are people here from all the political spectrum, but I would like to find more subs like this where you can talk about Israel/Palestine, about history, the war, etc. What other subs are there?

There are many subs that are very extreme left and pro-Palestinian so it is difficult to talk there, so what I am looking for is not a sub that is 100 percent pro-Israel but a balanced one so that discussions can be held there like in this sub.

Many subs here are very extreme left, pro-Palestinian and quite delusional, they are quite very extreme echo chambers and that is why I emphasize that I am not looking for a sub that is extreme pro-Israel but balanced and from all sides and from all wings",neutral,neutral,
