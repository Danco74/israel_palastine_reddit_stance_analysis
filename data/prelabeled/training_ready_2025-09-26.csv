This is the annual top 500 Muslims of the world list. It is published out of Jordan and, to no one's surprise, Jordan's king is always in the top spots.

This year, he is #1 and his wife was declared the most influential Muslim woman.

The level of self-delusion is hilarious, of course, and worthy of mockery. But what makes it outrageous are the reasons given for the king being #1.

The reason: he is ""the most effective Islamic leader"" dealing with the Israel-Palestine War!

Why?

Because he has air-dropped a few cargo containers into Gaza AND he shot down Iranian missiles headed to Tel Aviv, thereby preventing a bigger war.

17qsug6,IsrealPalestineWar_23,"Shouldnt Israel release there 2.5M hostages 1st Just a question and wondering peoples thoughts on this.

First is the definition of a hostage: a person seized or held as security for the fulfillment of a condition.

By this definition the 200 something people that were taken by Hamas on October 7th are definitely hostages.

But this definition also fits the 2.5M people that have been locked in a concentration camp for the last 70 years, many of which were born into that bondage.

Shouldn't Israel release their 2.5 million hostages before Hamas releases their 200 something hostages? Or really, if Israel releases their 2.5 million hostages, don't their 200 hostages get released as a consequence or byproduct??

Bibi doesn’t represent Israel interests There’s an increase in protests against the war in Israel. People with military background and even those in active service are participating in those. Hostages families are calling to stop the war, big parts in the public are calling to stop it. 

And all this time Netanyahu tried to paint them as Pro Palestine, or even Pro Hamas (which I didn’t include in the title as their view is pro terrorism)

Do these people who protest don’t want Israel best interests? People who lived, served, have families here, fought and even lost friends and family in these wars. 

Since the war started Bibi tried to make the protest non political, not to target him. Hostage families even reported getting calls from Netanyahu party telling them to not mention him in their protest as it will only hurt their loved ones.

For too long he been trying, with great success to attach “Pro Israeli” to supporting his policies, and not supporting his policies to be Pro Hamas, kept saying how it strengthened them. 

He doesn’t represents Israel interest, he represents his own, and his extremist government. Israel interest is to end this war and leave in peace, his interest is to conquer Gaza and settle there, which will only cause more wars and suffering. In the name of power, or religious belief or some sort of imperialism though.

Standing up against him is supporting Israel, pushing Israel to peace is supporting Israel, resolving the Israeli Palestinian conflict is supporting Israel.

Evangelicals technically ”support Israel”, under their belief there’s a prophecy that “the whole Israel” will bring a 3rd world war that will destroy the world and then Christ will return. So do they support Israel? Giving a child a fork because he asked to stick it in the outlet is supporting him?

Stop calling supporting Netanyahu policies supporting Israel, and vise versa. 

Many of the world leaders support Israel by not supporting Netanyahu. They do not support Hamas as they keep repeating. But supporting Palestine and supporting peace is Israel interest too.",,

1jakou7,IsraelPalestine,"Israel Land theft in West Bank and Syria is Greater Israel project All of us the entire world says Stealing is Wrong. And Israel is no Exception.

reasons behind Israel's breaches of global rules remain unclear. The destruction of Palestinian homes in the West Bank is ongoing. This creates a constant crisis. Illegal settlements keep growing. This violates past deals and creates tension.

Israel's military actions in Syria also cause worry. They say it's to protect the Druze people. But this feels like an excuse to invade. Imagine if another country invaded the U.S. Their stated reason? To protect a specific group from the U.S. government. Global law forbids such actions. No country can invade another simply to protect a group.

There's no clear answer for why Israel breaks international law. The destruction of Palestinian homes in the West Bank continues. Illegal settlements keep expanding, violating established agreements.

Israel's actions against Syria also raise concerns. The stated reason was to protect the Druze population. This justification feels like a pretext for invasion. Imagine another country invading the United States. The reason? To protect a specific group against the U.S. government. International law does not allow such interference.

Claiming to protect a group doesn't justify violating another nation's sovereignty. This situation appears linked to the Greater Israel Project. Expanding territory beyond recognized borders is happening. Building settlements in the West Bank breaks international law. It also violates the laws governing the West Bank itself. How can Israel's supporters justify these actions?

Also the Druze are in agreement with Syrian government, just because you get few people to agree with you doesn't give you the right.

1jztvt6,IsraelPalestine,"Hamas refusing to disarm is no different than if Germany in WW2 refused to unconditionally surrender Hamas recently rejected another ceasefire opportunity because it refuses to give up its weapons. The idea that there can be peace or a ""permanent ceasefire"" without Hamas diarming is silly and its refusal to do so would be no different from Germany asking for an end to WW2 without agreeing to disarm.

Note that when WW2 ended, Germany and Japan were compelled to surrender unconditionally and disarm completely. This was not a suggestion—it was a necessity. The Allied powers at the time knew that there could never be peace with these regimes as they had launched wars of conquest, destruction, and committed atrocities on a massive scale. Disarmament at the time was not merely a negotiating point, it was an objective prerequisite for stability, justice, and the rebuilding of nations. Allowing Germany and Japan to remain militarzied would have hampered peace efforts and undermined the gains from the war.

Similarly, Hamas today cannot remain armed if people actually care about peace. Their brutality - not only to Israel but to their own people - is well documented. And not to mention that their leaders are on record expressing desire and promises that events like October 7 would happen again and again. Their goal isn't peace, but the destruction of Israel. Don't take my word for it, take theirs.

Allowing militarized remnants of the Nazi regime or the Japanese imperial war machine to remain intact would have been a betrayal of global peace efforts and a direct threat to postwar security.

For Israel, similar to the allies powers back then, a demand for disarmament is not just political posturing. It's a necessity for peace. A ceasefire without surrender or disarmament would allow Hamas to regroup and rearm, just as it has done repeatedly in the past.

To oppose Hamas’s disarmament is essentially to argue that a group responsible for deliberate civilian massacres, hostage-taking, and decades of incitement should retain its war-making capabilities. Imagine if Germany had asked to retain the SS or if Japan had demanded to keep its kamikaze units under the guise of self-defense. The world would have seen those demands for what they were: a refusal to accept defeat and a recipe for future bloodshed.

Disarmament and surrender are not just symbols of defeat—they’re the first steps toward genuine peace and accountability. History has shown us what happens when violent ideologies are allowed to fester under the guise of resistance or national pride. For any meaningful peace to take hold, especially one that can ensure long-term safety for both Palestinians and Israelis, it's pretty clear that Hamas needs to disarm. I would go so far as to say that anyone opposed to the disarming of Hamas is more fueled by anti-israel sentiment than actual care and concern for Palestinians.

I was thinking about the Assad reign in Syria, and the numbers were reported to be 500000 people dead because of the Civil War, which is also as devastating as the current war in Gaza. To generalise, we know that Assad and the ruling party were Alawites (Shia Islam), and their opposition were majority Sunni Islam. Now maybe this is because it happened in 2011, and the internet was not like it is now, or the heavy censorship by the Assad regime, but I don’t see as much condemnation and outrage towards Assad as there is towards the current Israeli government, from both non-muslims and muslims alike, I have also seen some muslims defending Assad on instagram, etc.

So it made me wonder, what if Israel were not Jewish and instead muslim, say Shia like Assad was. What would the reaction be? Would the majority still side with Palestine because they are Sunni Islam?

1j542qa,IsraelPalestine,"The mainstream narrative of Israeli history is revisionism # Myth number 1: Zionists ""took over"" Palestine from the native Arabs through violent dispossession

**Reality**: Zionists settled down peacefully, in the face of massive discrimination and violence.

There is not a single documented case of Jews violently taking over land in Ottoman or British Mandatory Palestine before all-out war broke out in 1948. All Jewish land acquisitions were done legally and peacefully, through purchase or lease. This was despite Ottoman laws, later maintained and even expanded by the British, restricting the rights of Jews to live and make a living in their ancestral homeland.

By contrast, there are scores of documented cases of expulsions of Jews, even entire communities, well before the 1948 war; for example, the [Hebron massacre of 1929](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacre#Decline_of_Jewish_community). Even in the face of such violence, Jews were systematically forbidden from organizing to protect themselves—when they did, it had to be clandestine.

# Myth number 2: Zionists conquered Palestine in a war of aggression

**Reality**: The fledgling state of Israel defended itself against an openly genocidal offensive by the Arab League; it managed to survive.

When the Jewish leaders in the former Mandate accepted UNGA 181, the Partition Plan, they were well aware of the genocidal rhetoric from the Arab League. Its Secretary-General, Azzam Pasha, [had stated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azzam_Pasha_quotation): ""The creation of a Jewish state would lead to a war of extermination and momentous massacre which will be spoken of like the Mongolian massacre and the Crusades."" They prepared to be attacked.

The attack came. Hours after the British Mandate had formally ended, the armies of Egypt, Transjordan, and Syria crossed its border, joining local Arab forces in an all-out offensive against Jewish targets. They made no distinction between Jewish civilians and soldiers: no Jews were left alive in Arab-controlled land.

The newborn state of Israel managed to resist, even pushing back in some areas. When the fighting ended nearly a year later, Israel had survived, though its continued existence was far from assured.

# Myth number 3: The creation of Israel prevented the birth of a Palestinian state

**Reality**: The expansionist ambitions of Jordan and Egypt prevented the birth of a Palestinian state.

When the Israeli War of Independence ended with a truce in 1949, Arab forces found themselves in possession of considerable land. An Arab Palestinian state could well have been created on it; indeed, a façade of one, the All-Palestine government, was set up. But neither Jordan nor Egypt, the principal powers exercising actual control, were interested in Palestinian self-government: Egypt moved the seat of the All-Palestine government to Cairo, then dissolved it; Jordan formally annexed the area under its control in 1950.

# Myth number 4: Israel ethnically cleansed the Arabs from its territory in the Nakba

**Reality**: While some expulsions and massacres were committed by Israeli forces, Israel enacted no such overall plan and maintained a substantial Arab minority; it was the Jews who were wholly eradicated from Arab-held land.

During the Israeli War of Independence, there were indeed several cases of massacres and mass expulsions of Arab civilians at the hands of Israeli forces. Regardless of justifications offered, such as the ""military necessity"" of denying Arab guerrillas the cover of Arab-inhabited villages, these acts were illegal and immoral. However, they were not part of an overall ethnic cleansing plan, and Israel retained a significant Arab minority.

By contrast, every last Jew was killed or expelled from Arab-controlled land on explicit ethno-religious grounds, as mandated by the Arab leadership. Even more: starting soon after the war, the Arab and other Muslim states began large-scale persecutions of their native Jewish communities, leading [close to a million Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_exodus_from_the_Muslim_world) to flee from the Muslim world, most of them resettling in Israel.

# Myth number 5: The 1949 borders are the natural borders of Israel

**Reality**: The 1949 armistice line was explicitly agreed to be neither a border nor a future basis of one. Jews had lived beyond it for millennia before being eradicated by the advancing Arab armies.

Israel substantially increased its territorial control in the Six-Day War, triggered by an Egyptian blockade of the Straits of Tiran. Twenty years after being ethnically cleansed from them, Jews could putatively return to the historical regions of Judea and Samaria, as well as the Gaza Strip.

This re-settlement would begin very slowly: the territory had been wholly depopulated of Jews, and the local population was extremely hostile, making it impossible for Jewish civilians to simply move in peacefully. Instead, separate communities needed to be created—which is the reason why today there are Israeli settlements rather than simply Jewish neighborhoods or individual homes.

To claim that this Jewish presence is illegal is tantamount to stating that the twenty years of ethnic cleansing perpetrated by Jordan constitute a righteous *status quo ex ante*, and that Jews are foreign to the land of Judea and the very Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem—both of which were Jordanian territory for those twenty years.

# Myth number 6: Israel has committed genocide against the Palestinians

**Reality**: Jews and other non-Arab, non-Muslim minorities were the only ones to be genocided in the region.

The Arab population of Israel, of the Palestinian territories, and the Palestinian Arab population in neighboring Arab states have all, separately and collectively, consistently increased throughout Israel's existence, in total number and as a percentage. Israeli Arabs can speak and receive education in their native language, freely practice their religion, and maintain their customs—as can Arabs living under Arab governments, of course. Neither physical nor cultural genocide has been perpetrated against them.

By contrast, nearly all Jews across the Arab and Muslim world were ethnically cleansed through violence and large-scale persecution, leading to the collapse and near-complete eradication of these populations—most of them fleeing to Israel. In addition, ethno-religious minorities like Palestinian Christians have endured discrimination and persecution at the hands of Arab and Muslim supremacists, leading to a collapse in their number—both total and as a percentage of the Palestinian population.

# Myth number 7: Israel is currently genociding the Palestinians of Gaza, chiefly through starvation

**Reality**: The government of Gaza committed the largest pogrom since WWII, triggering a defensive war by Israel. Israel has continued to supply Gaza with more than enough humanitarian supplies; Gaza's government and its militias have stolen a large part of it.

When Hamas, its allies, and tagalong Gazan civilians engaged in the October 7th attacks and subsequent atrocities, the Israeli military responded by launching a large-scale counter-offensive, clearing out Israeli territory and then taking the fight to the strongholds in Gaza. Hamas and its allies systematically embed themselves in civilian areas and structures, openly seeking to make human shields of their own civilian population, whom they call upon and often force at gunpoint to remain in place when Israel warns them to leave ahead of combat operations.

In spite of Hamas and its allies' best efforts to imperil their own people, Israel has continued to supply Gaza with a massive flow of humanitarian aid, providing more than enough for the sustenance of the Gazan population. Widely repeated claims of starvation failed to match reality, with next to no actual starvation deaths reported even by Gaza's own health authorities. This was despite Hamas and its allies' continued attacks on humanitarian infrastructure, transports, and workers—with stolen aid typically being resold for a profit in Gazan markets.

#Myth number 8: Israel is a rogue state

**Reality**: Israel has shown matchless restraint in the face of the most enduring, violent hatred the world has ever seen.

After the definitive military defeat of the Arab states in the Yom Kippur War, which ended any hopes of debellating Israel by conventional means, antizionist efforts switched overwhelmingly to terrorism. Palestinian terrorism majorly targeted Israel, but also its allies, like in the [1973 Fiumicino attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Rome_airport_attacks_and_hijacking), and Jewish targets around the world - such as the murder of [Leon Klinghoffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Klinghoffer), a disabled American Jew who was shot and thrown overboard from the hijacked *Achille Lauro* in 1985.

In the face of this, Israel built escalating security measures, culminating in the West Bank barrier, which succeded in stopping the waves of suicide bombings that had regularly targeted Israeli busses, cafes and public areas in the previous years. Israel has since then added an extensive network of air shelters, and a sophisticated missile defense system, to protect its people from the thousands of rockets and missiles which Islamist armed groups began relying more and more - including during the Gaza war.

#Myth number 9: antizionism is not antisemitism

**Reality**: the belief that Israel represents a unique evil, such that it is the only state in the world that can only be 'fixed' by eliminating it, is inextricably antisemitic.

Controversial states are no novelty. Yet only Israel is systematically asserted to require nothing short of elimination. Reform, revolution, even foreign-imposed regime change is invoked for hostile countries - but with Israel, and Israel alone, a large and somewhat legitimised opinion movement demands outright elimination.

This belief in Israel's existence representing a unique evil, this casual slide into assuming that the only solution is its destruction, is rooted in antisemitism. Millennia of Jew hatred, depicting them as monsters and enemies of humanity, naturally translated - either consciously or unconsciously - into treating the one Jewish State in the world as something that *naturally* warrants annihilation.",,

🇵🇸: You bombed our only crossing into Egypt. Plus how are we supposed to get food, water, electricity? You bombed all of our hospitals, we have no healthcare. At this rate a quarter of our population will be dead in a year because of that! 

🇮🇱: Again, talk to Egypt. And giving yall food and water is pointless anyways cuz Hamas will just steal everything. Plus it's not even our responsibility. Plus the one time we did try to be nice for once yall broke out in a panic that left dozens of your own people dead and you still tried to blame it on us. Just like that that hospital incident that was actually a Hamas rocket misfire. Also, maybe if yall stopped shooting rockets from schools, hospitals, and underground maybe we wouldn't have to bomb those areas. 

🇵🇸: OK, so you're just going to use Hamas as a scapegoat for everything? Got it. And it was your fault for the 100+ people dying. Mind to explain all those gunshot wounds? 

🇮🇱: Gladly. We did fire into that crowd because people started charging us. Then once we fired everyone panicked, crowd crush, tanks roll over everyone (they weren't driven by us btw). What did you want us to do? 

🇵🇸: Actually plan out how you were gonna deliver food to hundreds of starving people who are on the verge of going mad. Your method was horribly dumb to begin with. 

🇮🇱: You forgetting we are at war? You should be lucky you're getting ANYTHING from us. You are the enemy. 

🇵🇸: This has gone far beyond war. You committed multiple war crimes, violated the Geneva Conventions, starving out our people, and continously bombing en masse an area that you yourself said is smaller than a large city. 

🇮🇱: Ok so what? You wanted war, you got war. Y'all continuously have called for another genocide of our people and supported and cheered when Oct. 7th happened. We have simply responded, and we will not stop until all of our hostages are free and Hamas is 100% gone. Hell, if we really wanted you all gone, trust us, you'd have been gone a long time ago. 

🇵🇸: We didn't want war. We wanted to be free and to have our land back. You forced our hand. 

🇮🇱: Oh, now look who's playing ""victim."" We already said we weren't leaving the land we already had. Deal with it. We gave you the Gaza Strip and left it in 2005. Then you elected a terrorist group as your government. A group that time and time again has wanted all of us dead. Then they kept firing rockets and missiles at us ever since then, which is one of the reasons we had the blockades up in the first place. 

🇵🇸: Still doesn't excuse the indiscriminate bombings

🇮🇱: We bomb strategic military sites and the places that rockets are launched from. It is not our fault that those things happen to be in civilian areas. 

🇵🇸: How about all of your soldiers who gladly document ALL of the war crimes you committed? 

🇮🇱: We're not perfect and never claimed to be. Why do we have to explain ourselves when American, British, Japanese, Russian, and perhaps every other known country (ESPECIALLY YOU) has committed comparable or worse war crimes? 

🇵🇸: Because they're still war crimes! No excuses. You do it with a smile on your face too.

🇮🇱: Oct 7th? The multiple OTHER times you've bombed us? Of course we gonna be happy getting revenge on terrorists. 

🇵🇸: You just assumed we're all terrorists. 

🇮🇱: You all cheered when Oct. 7th happened so, to some extent, we do. 

🇵🇸: And your stated goal is to kill all of the terrorists. You're committing genocide. 

🇮🇱: You're twisting my words.

🇵🇸: Oh so tell me how I should interpret genocidal talk? 

🇮🇱: Oh I'm tired of this crap you want another ceasefire? I'll think about it. 

🇵🇸: Screw you.

🇮🇱: Screw you too.

Overall, my opinion now is that from sheer arguments, statistics, and evidence alone, Israel isn't technically committing a genocide. However, as one comment put it, they're prioritizing Hamas and the hostages over the well-being of the Gazans. And, due to this fact, the well-being of all of the Gazans remains threatened, and therefore, there should be actions taken to make sure this doesn't turn into a genocide. Better safe than sorry, as they say.",,

I’ve attempted to put into something I can relate to in order to follow along. I mean absolutely no disrespect to anyone or any group and I’m not looking to get in any arguments. I’m looking to get educated on the issue. Any help with my comparison would be helpful. Please don’t write mean things. 


My attempt at trying to start to figure out what’s happening…..

Awhile ago America (Israel) said California (Palestine) we are done. America cuts off California and says you aren’t a part of the America anymore. But we still kinda control you. 

Then the California (Palestine) gang members of the bloods or crips (Hammas, but they are the same race) cross the border to Arizona (America) and kill a ton of Americans. And keep fucking with Arizona (Israel) 

After that there’s multiple protests from American (Israel) and California (Palestine) students that live and goto college in (let’s say Spain) 

But there’s also multiple students that live and goto college in Spain from California (Palestine) who believe the Bloods and Crips (Hammas, but they are the same race just different religious beliefs?) are fighting for their rights as a country. 

Both sides of the Americans and Californians are protesting in Spain’s universities where a majority of the individuals protesting are black (just using for reference, it's more religious based and the Americans and Californians are the same race). And the news keeps saying the protests are racist (antisemitism) 

The students from America (Israel) are butting heads with Californians (Palestine) in Spain and shutting down the schools to make people aware of their struggles that are going on back in the USA. 

Then the schools in Spain finally says look students you're not going to graduate if you continue to protest. Discovering a majority of the protestors both Americans and California's don't goto school there and possibly have been brought in from Portugal and other parts of Spain. 

Neighboring country like Canada (Iran) does not like America (Israel) and is helping fund the Bloods and Crips (Hammas) to fight against America.",,
1ks5j4v,IsraelPalestine,"Israel : We should Bomb humanitarian aid and‘starve’ Gazans Heritage Minister Amichay Eliyahu said Monday that Israel should bomb food and fuel reserves in Gaza to starve the population as part of a strategy of exerting direct pressure on Hamas by targeting the civilian population.

“We must stop humanitarian aid,” the Otzma Yehudit minister told Israel National News. “As long as we give food to those who fight us — we are endangering our hostages and our soldiers.”

He accused Gaza’s civilian population of supporting Hamas’s October 7 massacre and said it should be made to suffer the consequences.

“[The civilians] gave Hamas the wind in its sails,” Eliyahu said. “If the people of Gaza suffer, Hamas will suffer. There is no problem bombing their food and fuel reserves. They should starve.”

Eliyahu, an observant Jew and grandson of former Sephardi chief rabbi of Israel Mordechai Eliyahu, dismissed arguments that withholding food contradicts Jewish values.

The period marks the longest time in which no aid has entered the Palestinian territory since war broke out with Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.

It’s absolutely chilling to hear a sitting government minister openly advocate for what essentially amounts to collective punishment and war crimes. Bombing food and fuel reserves isn’t just a “strategy” — it’s an assault on the very basics of civilian survival. No matter how someone tries to justify it, starving over two million people, half of whom are children, is not a legitimate military tactic. It’s barbaric. To hear Amichay Eliyahu say that Gaza’s civilians “gave Hamas the wind in its sails” is a terrifying example of how easily a government official can dehumanize an entire population, lumping every man, woman, and child as a terrorists

What’s worse is that this kind of rhetoric isn’t coming from some fringe internet voice — it’s coming from someone who holds real power and influence within Israel’s government. That should scare anyone who cares about human rights and international law. The idea that withholding humanitarian aid could “save” hostages or protect soldiers is not only morally indefensible, it’s also strategically naive. Pushing people to desperation often leads to more chaos, not less.

It’s disturbing how openly this contradicts not just international norms, but also the moral values that so many people — including Eliyahu, who leans on religious identity — claim to uphold. There’s no ethical system on Earth that condones starving children to send a political message. And to do so under the banner of state policy? That’s not self-defense — that’s cruelty for cruelty’s sake.

1fwj7pp,IsraelPalestine,"antisemitism, what is and what isn't, and the different ways it manifests  So when I began listening to Politics right around 2016-2020, especially 2020, I got more in tune with what it is to be either right or left. The history of both parties, and the history of racism and antisemitism. The biggest atrocity in world history has been the holocaust. The horror of how they essentially industrialized genocide. 

 So, we have seen a rise in antisemitism since 2016. With the Proud Boys sporting shirts that say ""6 million wasn't enough"", or Charlottesville neo-Nazties chanting ""Jews will not replace us"". MTG's whole controversy about ""Jewish Space Lazers"", and the entire dog whistles with conservatives referring to our problems being caused by ""Globalists"", or ""George Soros"". We all know what they mean when they state those claims. Lots of conspiracy theories that make no sense eventually find their way to antisemitism. It's wild seeing what people believe. Then you have the ""Great Replacement Theory"", in which it states that Jews are flooding the country with immigrants and encouraging race-mixing in order to ""exterminate the aryan race"".

 As of recent, I think the right has been cashing in on the Israel/Palestine situation from various fronts. 


  But before we get to this, I think there are 2 forms of antisemitism at play here. One is more nefarious, the other is mostly a reaction to the given situation. 

 Antisemitism from the right is often what I consider, old-school European antisemitism. The right has more practice in trying to push antisemitism in the most subtle ways possible. Like I stated above, they often use dog whistles and try to give themselves plausible deniability. So they can gaslight anyone that has caught on to their game. It's nefarious and devious because they figured out how to push it into the mainstream. People buy it without realizing it. Whenever they hear globalists, they don't understand what the right really means. Those that are in on it, tap their nose and nod. Those who are not in on it and politically illiterate, buy it without knowing much of what it means. European/American antisemitism has a long list of books and wacky conspiracies about Jews that are borderline schizo. It's an entire school of thought (or more accurately, lack of thought).

 On ""the left"", it is not the exact same. And I put ""the left"" in quotes because you can't really claim to be part of the left and believe the Jews are responsible for this situation as if they're a monolith. It's antithetical to left-wing ideals. It's probably better to say, antisemitism from the arab world. Where does it come from? Well, I'd say it's more of a reaction by people who know too little. They see bombs drop, they see the Star of David on the Israeli flag and in their minds they put 2 and 2 together. It's how it manifests in groups like Hamas. Because like white supremacists, religious leaders are quick to recruit people who are in dire situations. They give them an enemy and a chance for retribution. More educated people know it's not Jews. In fact, the blame goes all the way to US Imperialist motives.

 I wouldn't even call antisemitism on the pro-Palestinian side ""left-wing"", because if you're an antisemitic Muslim that hates the Jews, you are right-wing. By virtue of your beliefs coming from a religious perspective. The left often doesn't like organized religion.

 Often people accuse the left of being ok with Muslims who would commit atrocities. Not really, they are more concerned with left-leaning people from the arab world escaping right-wing extremist Muslims.

 The sad thing about the Gaza/Israel situation is that Israel is claiming to do this in the name or ""protecting a Jewish state"". It essentially implicates all Jews around the world. Because let's face it, humans are very prone to reacting and not thinking. So it fuels antisemitism. 


 Now there are a few fronts the right likes to open when it comes to antisemitism.

Pro-Israel antisemites: 

- People who see Jews and Israel as a means to an end. They are often Evangelical Christians. In fact, they are the biggest donors of Aipac. They believe Israel is where the battle of Armageddon is supposed to happen. So they are hell-bent on defending Israel, not out of love for Jews, probably not even out of hatred for Arabs, but out of the idea of being sucked into heaven when Jesus comes back according to their prophecy. *And according to their prophecy*, everyone else burns in eternal fire, including the majority of Jews (some are supposed to convert to Christianity, implying Jew is the wrong religion).

- People like Richard Spencer who admire Israel as a blueprint for a white-only ethnostate. He admires how Israel deals with Palestinians, and wishes he could do the same to minorities in the US and in Europe. People like him also see Israel as a place to exile Jews to. To him, he sees it as ""Wow, there's a place in the Middle East we can send Jews away to? And they'll willingly go? And on top of that they they kill arabs? We didn't even ask for that, but it's a bonus! I'll take it!""

- People who are antisemite but hate Arabs more than Jews. That's pretty self-explanatory right there.

 Then there are anti-Israel antisemites:

- Nick Fuentes, just hates Jews, hates Israel, and anything to do with Jews. Not much else to say about that piece of booger-eating trash.

- Right-wingers who hate Arabs, but hate Jews way more. So they jump on the pro-Palestinian side while still thinking of Arabs as ""sand-N-Words"".

- actual pro-Palestinians that aren't really educated and end up adopting right-wing antisemitism. 

 There are also often right-wingers who play both sides. Egging them on because what better for a person who hates both Jews and Arabs to watch them kill one another?

 So oftentimes, we can see antisemitism as a canary in a coal mine. To see where your country is going. If you are pretty well versed in right-wing talking points, you can catch what they say. You know their point of view is eventually gonna lead towards ""it's the Jews"".

 But I also see it as a frame of reference for how other minorities are scapegoated. Such as how the Haitians have been demonized in the states. Or immigrants as a whole. In fact, the whole pet-eating controversy pushed by JD Vance originates from a neo-Nahztie group called ""Blood Tribe"". Same with the LGBTQ community. Remember the last general election when the right was all about how there's a big ""trans agenda"". Making it seem like there's a big ""trans cabal"" that is trying to trans your kids. Funny enough, it eventually leads right back to them accusing Jews of doing it. This is why I sympathize with Jewish people feeling unsafe. Then there is how I see people refer to Palestinians as animals or anything else than human. I've seen someone post that they are a ""cancer of humanity"", or calling them an ""infestation"". Sound familiar? That's similar to when the Jews were referred to as ""vermin"". Although the people who posted that were not Jewish themselves (I highly doubt it). 

 As for people in Israel, Jews and Israelis aren't a monolith. There are Jews who are against what Israel is doing, some even claim that it's a sin for Israel to exist because it's not supposed to happen until the messiah comes back and tells the Jews to build Israel(someone check me on this, I'm just stating what I heard). There are Israeli Jews who are against what Israel is doing. And then there are right-wing Israelis like Likud and many settlers who adopted the same mindset of white nationalists. Anyone can become right-wing, anyone can become fascist.

 The atrocities in Rwanda? They invoked similar rhetoric to justify genocide. 


 But ya, my conclusion is that yes, antisemitism can pop out from Palestinian movements. But those are easy to squash. Because they stick out like sore thumb.

 Right-wing antisemitism is more on the low, and often pretends to be the opposite. 

Oh ya, also watch out for people that say ""Cultural Marxism"", that's a play on the phrase ""Jewish Bolshevism"". Organizations like Breitbart often accuse George Soros of spreading ""Cultural Marxism"", or even accuse the Frankfurt School which has many Jewish members. 

Some food for thought:

 As for me, I always called out antisemitism. I correct people who try to refer to the Jews when it comes to Israel and Palestine. I call out people who spew antisemitic conspiracy theories.

18mnubz,IsraelPalestine,"Processing my thoughts Since Oct 7 I feel like I have had lots of mixed emotions about what’s going on and I haven’t been able to get them off my chest. I want to start this off by saying I just want to process my thoughts and feelings about what’s going on because I am a Jew in America but I have conflicted emotions and just kind of need to vent.

I feel grief, sadness, a little bit of guilt, and confusion. Confused for the future and sad for the innocent life that has been lost in unfathomable amounts. I feel almost guilty for being Jewish knowing what the Israeli government is doing basically in the name of Judaism.

One of my biggest thoughts is that there are radicals on both sides. I struggle when I see my friends supporting Israel unequivocally maybe without acknowledging the Palestinian deaths and what has happened to them for the last 75 years. However I do still support the innocent people of Israel but I also support the innocent Palestinians who have been affected the most. This past summer I visited Israel, and they tried to teach us about the war from their perspective. I met some IDF soldiers who didn’t want to be fighting themselves. And this is another thing, I see a lot of people online who think the whole IDF is bad because of the bad apples. I’m not defending the bad ones who do horrific things, however I now have friends in the IDF who I know are good people and wouldn’t do those bad things and it makes me sad seeing people generalize them.

But it also pains me when I see online people who will say things like “You’re a jew who cares what you think” or “Hitler should’ve finished the job” and might say this in the name of the Palestinian cause. I know not all Palestinian supporters are antisemitic, I would be a fool if I did believe that. I am not the victim here but I am scared with the rise of antisemitism. I have also seen comments online where people just post videos of themselves wrapping tefillin (a Jewish thing that more religious people do, I am not that religious) and have nothing to do with the war and get called a dirty jew or a Zionist.

Maybe some people might say my feelings aren’t valid or this and that but while I believe Hamas is a horrible terrorist group who does want to get rid of the Jews all over the world, the people running the Israel government have prejudice towards the Palestinians as well and don’t see those people equal to themselves. I just want this war to end as much as the next guy. I want Jews and Muslims in the Middle East to coexist peacefully. I want the Israel government to stop having hate towards the Palestinians and I want the people who hate Jews in the Middle East to stop having hate towards the Jews.

1et0kod,IsraelPalestine,"Will Palestine ever get its own state? I don’t know much about this conflict, so I guess this is more of a question for the sub. Will Palestine ever get its own state?

I keep hearing that Israel has been willing to negotiate over the last 75 years but Palestine wants all of the land. I can understand why they want all of the land. The Nakba was such a tragic event for many Arabs, and I understand why Arafat , coined the idea of Palestine.

It was always a European term that the Arabs rejected. The Mandate of Palestine contained Jews and Arabs before 1948. The Arabs living in Gaza considered themselves to be Egyptian. The Arabs living in the West Bank considered themselves to be Jordanian. The Arabs living in Golan considered themselves to be Syrian or Lebanese.

Regardless of the term, many of these Arabs were displaced from their home when the UN project of Israel was formed to give Jews their own state. I understand the Jewish claim to the land as well. The Jews lived in Israel before Islam was even an idea, but that doesn’t change the fact that Arabs were displaced 75 years ago and have had their lives uprooted and ruined.

So we have:

•Jews were there first in ancient times and currently have the power over the land.

And

•Arabs were there before the current Israelis, and they were clearly there first (in modern times) compared to common day Israelis.

So how do we solve the problem? Can these 2 groups share the land? Can they live there together? Should Palestinians be condemned for attacking Israel? Or has Knesset been so unreasonable that Palestinians only option is to attack and hope for the best in the aftermath?

If Israel is willing to put a deal on the table that gives Palestine its own state, will Palestinians be willing to allow Israel to exist in their own minds? Who is to blame for all this? 

Ok, well these are my questions for the more educated folks in the sub? I just hope that one day these 2 groups will stop hating each other and can live side by side. It would be such a dream to see Israel as a thriving economy full of tech innovation and thought leadership living peacefully next to Palestine, a country full of good, nonviolent people with oil accessibility and other offerings to the world. It would be great to see them treat each other as allies and as cousins rather than as mortal enemies.

The Arab world + The West have got to find cooperation. Israel is modeled more like the West and could be a great partner for the 2 groups. If this partnership is ever achieved, then I believe the world will see more stability, more cooperative economic prosperity, and more overall kindness. 

Maybe I’m just a foolish optimist, but I sincerely hope that these 2 groups can get along.",,

1. The Total Destruction Of Judea (Modern West Bank of Israel/Palestine)

\- Emperor Hadrian eliminated almost all Jews through the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE) and renamed Judea to ""Syria Palaestina"" in an effort to de-Judaize the region. Some Arab nationalists and a few Muslims in the modern era see this as aligning with their own narratives in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

1kccu0p,IsraelPalestine,"The other type of Israeli settlers. Not all settlers are violent and sociopaths. Many are just ordinary people Disclaimer: This video is from a pro-Israel site...

https://youtu.be/UH8IzRNr6kM?si=9yRlRTdcrgw4bFu0

Although not perfect, at the very least it tells the story from the pro-Israel side. What I mean is there is a slight biasness i am thinking 20% (it's not entirely biased..there are Palestinian voices too and difficult questions). We frequently get questions....i dont understand why Israel...can you pls explain why ? etc... this video do explain why from a Pro-Israeli side.  So it might be interesting for people who might be interested to hear their side of the story. 

I can understand it might be difficult for any pro-Palestinian supporter to listen to any video from the opposing side, may I suggest you mute it and just watch without listening. Many have seen Louis Theroux's The Settlers, I wanted to just say not every settler is like that, carry a gun, violent, radical, part of Daniella Weiss's group, live in a temporary plank wood house etc...This video show settlers like ordinary people, in proper brick houses with gardens, schools, bakers, enterprenuers (they employ Palestinians), dont carry guns, arent supporters of Daniella Weiss (they think she and her group are trouble makers), some are even secular, live peacefully with Palestinians (friends/neighbors). 

What this video fell short is its only explaining 1/3 of the story, the secular and non-radical settlers, it briefly mentioned the hill top youths (wish they would have included some pics for balance). Louis Theroux explained 1/3 of the story. The violent parts. Both this video and Louis Theroux didnt mention another group, the Haredi, Ultra Orthodox group. Hence neither video gives the complete picture of settlers.

Even in the video, not all settlements are identical. Some are very friendly, peaceful and get along with their Palestinian neighbors. Others are wary of Palestinians. Some like the hill top youths are violent. You will hear that some people would like a two states solutions. Some people said if its no longer possible to live in the West Bank, they will move back to Israel proper. Not show in the video, there are even politicians who live in the West Bank saying if the day comes we can agree on peace and a Two State Solution, he will happily leave West Bank. 

I didnt like some of the guest commetators in the video, like Alan Dershowitz, I didnt think he added much to the story, wasnt necessary. 

There are some important take away from the story. Many Israelis dont believe the settlements per say is preventing peace. I.e. if all settlements were removed, the very next day, there will still be no peace. Some settlers can be problematic, but Settlements are not ""The Biggest"" problem. This video argues extreme ideologies from both sides are the biggest obstacles to peace.

The most noteworthy scene is when a Jewish settler, business owner stands in front of a wall in his office, full of photos... he explained proudly, we go on company trips together, both palestinians and israeli workers, travelling, having a good time, relaxing, that is his story he wants people to see.",,

Of course, as a result, I've been a Palestine supporter for as long as I can remember. But I was never really involved in the Pro-Palestine movement until the start of the ongoing I/P conflict that's been happening since October. And where did I engage with all of this Pro-Palestine content? Twitter/X. Yeah, probably the worst place I could've possibly chosen.

I fully believed every single post I saw. And as the Pro-Palestine movement started to move towards extremism, I did, too. They say that there are no innocent Israelis because they're all colonizers? I believed them. They claim that everything Hamas did/does towards civilians is justified because of the violence of Israel's government? I believed them. They say that October 7th wasn't even that bad? Sure, I believed them! They claim that the IDF trained dogs to SA hostages? ...I fully believed them, no questions asked.

Then, one day, I found out that one of my online friends was a Zionist. Of course, I was absolutely appalled. I was fully conditioned to believe that Zionism = genocidal baby killers that want to see the pain and suffering of every Palestinian alive. At least, that's what all the videos/posts of Zionists shared in pro-Pali spaces showed. I couldn't believe that one of my friends considered herself a Zionist.

I got ready to completely cut her off, before I started looking at her reposts. And I started to realize that Zionism is a much more broad term than ""Genocidal, anti-Palestinian, baby killer"". In fact, a lot of Zionists didn't even support the awful actions of the Israeli government. This... baffled me. All my life, I'd been told that Israelis are evil, and would never want peace with Palestinians, or any Arab countries, for that matter. For all I knew, they wanted us dead! Yet, when I read the opinions of people who just wanted peace, I found myself fully agreeing with them.

There were Zionists and Israelis saying that, of course, they hate how many innocent lives have been taken in Gaza. But they also hate how many innocent lives have been taken in Israel, as well, which is completely valid. Hamas is an evil terrorist group, they always have been. And I can't even understand how I fully believed that they were good people who were just trying to protect the civilians in Gaza.

I've taken a step back from the Pro-Palestine movement, and I've realized how... insanely messed up it's all become. How is it that all of this violence and hatred against innocent Zionists and Israelis has become completely normalized? Why do people genuinely believe that sending hate towards these people who don't have anything to do with the conflict will help Palestinians in any way, shape or form? I just don't get it. I'm still learning, so please, correct me if I've said anything wrong, but this has truly been such an eye-opening experience for me. I still have so much love and empathy for the innocent Palestinians who are being killed and displaced, but I can't believe I've had to LEARN to have that empathy for innocent Israelis who've had the same thing happen to them. They've been so villainized and dehumanized, and I couldn't even see how wrong it was until now. I just want peace. How is that a ""controversial"" opinion?",,
1l39pob,IsraelPalestine,"Why Doesn't Israel Facilitate The Palestinian Authority To Govern Gaza? Beginning with the Oslo Accords in 1993, Israel negotiated with Fatah to create the Palestinian Authority in order to govern all of Palestine, and create a two state solution for peace between the two nations. Since then, Israel has implemented and honored many parts of the Oslo Accords, most notably in creating Areas A, B and C with the Palestinian Authority in West Bank, which were meant to be transitional arrangements to graduate into a two state solution but have remained frozen since 2001 creating in effect today what many people call apartheid/hafrada.

However, when Israel withdrew their occupation of Gaza in 2005, they refused to coordinate a security handoff with Fatah in order to maintain peace following the occupation as prescribed by the Oslo Accords. In principle, this was supposed to make Gaza function like an Area A does in West Bank, but without a coordinated security handoff to Fatah, extremist Hamas forces overtook Gaza, something Israel has been very careful to assist Fatah with avoiding in every other Area A territory. Fatah publicly begged Israel not to withdraw without a security handoff, warning that Hamas had superior forces in Gaza and it would certainly cause Gaza to become a Hamas stronghold.

Many have argued that Hamas taking Gaza is what narrowly won them the subsequent 2006 election as well, despite gaining just 44% of the vote. In the resulting civil war, Israel backed Fatah against Hamas, helping Fatah to win West Bank but leaving Gaza with Hamas. The Palestinian Authority remained governed by Fatah, but since then Israel has never attempted to extend this governance to Gaza again, despite occupying Gaza multiple times following wars like with Hamas, and upholding the rest of the Oslo Accords in their frozen state.

I understand Fatah is far from perfect, of course so is Likud. But, it is undeniable that West Bank is far more successful and far more peaceful than Gaza, despite Israel controlling all of Gaza's borders just as they do in every Area A territory in West Bank. Fatah's governance is far more progressive and liberal in the Western sense, secular rather than Islamic, with women occupying positions of power such as politicians, judges, and lawyers. Their economy is much stronger and more stable. They have not attacked Israel for 20yrs. They continue to seek a two state solution with Israel through the Arab Peace Initiative. Israel continues to facilitate their governance of the rest of Area A.

So why, even today when Israel has occupied Gaza again and is attempting to end Hamas' rule once and for all, do they not attempt to extend the governance of the Palestinian Authority from West Bank into Gaza? West Bank is 20x larger than Gaza, and has twice as many people. Their structure of governance could reasonably accommodate a much smaller area with half as many people. Previous to 2005, it did so with Israel's assistance. Polls show that the majority of Palestinians have often supported this idea as well, including today with a leader such as Marwan Barghouti, who many call the Palestinian Nelson Mandela. So, they even have the support of the Palestinian people.

This clearly seems to be the most realistic and obvious path to defeating Hamas politically now that Israel has defeated them militarily once again. Surely Fatah and the Palestinian Authority would be much preferable to coordinate with than Hamas, and this would be a huge step in the peace process. So, why has Israel refused to facilitate this as part of their adherence to the Oslo Accords?",,
1nmoq64,IsraelPalestine,"Israel vs Hamas Question is: Who do the Palestinians need freedom from? 

My understanding is (open to correction with sources):

1. A Long Time Ago: Both Jews and Arabs lived in this area for centuries. Jews see it as their ancient homeland (with religious ties to Jerusalem and beyond). Arabs (now referred to as Palestinians) also lived there for generations, farming and building communities.

2.	Early 1900s: The land was called Palestine and controlled by the Ottoman Empire, then by Britain after World War I.

Population During British Mandate Period: 
- Arabs (now referred to as Palestinians): ~65–70% of the population
- Jews: ~30–35% (many had recently immigrated, especially in the 1930s–40s fleeing persecution in Europe)
- Others (small groups like Druze, Circassians, Armenians): &lt;5%

More Jews, facing extreme discrimination and violence in Europe, started moving here where they had ancient roots, hoping to have their own nation to live freely (essence of Zionism). 

The Arabs (now referred to as Palestinians) already lived there and worried about being pushed out.

	3.	1947: The United Nations suggested splitting the land into two states — one Jewish, one Arab.
	•	Jews said yes.
	•	Arabs said no, feeling it was unfair. 

Why Palestinians said “no” to the UN partition plan (1947):
- Population numbers: At the time, Arabs were about two-thirds of the population of Palestine, while Jews were about one-third.
- Land ownership: Arabs owned most of the farmland (~80%). Jews, though growing in number (especially after the Holocaust), owned much less.

The UN plan: It gave Jews about 55% of the land — even though they were the minority — and Palestinians about 45%.
- For Palestinians, it felt unfair: they thought, “Why should outsiders who’ve only recently arrived get more land than us, when we’ve been the majority for generations?”

After the Holocaust (which killed 6 million Jews), global sympathy + Zionist efforts led to the creation of Israel.

4.	1948 – The Big Turning Point:
- Israel declared independence as a country.
- Neighboring Arab countries decided to help the Arab Palestinians and attacked, but Israel won the war. 
- Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled or were forced out (called the Nakba, or “catastrophe”).
- Israel took more land than the UN had originally planned.

Understandably, just like Jews who wanted their own homeland, the Arabs also want full self-determination. For some, that means all of historic Palestine, not just part.

5.	1967 – Another War: Israel, feeling encircled and threatened with annihilation from military moves by Egypt (allied with Jordan, and Syria), launched a surprise pre-emptive strike on Egypt’s air force. Israel won more land (the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem). These are areas Palestinians still want for their own country.

6.	Since Then:
- Israel: It is a strong, wealthy country. Many Jews feel safe here after centuries of persecution.

- Palestinians live mainly in the West Bank (partly under Israeli military control) and Gaza (run by Hamas since 2007, a militant Islamic terrorist group). 

Israel restricts movement of people and goods into/out of Gaza to stop weapons reaching Hamas.

Effect: severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine, electricity, and jobs → ordinary Palestinians suffer.

Many peace talks have failed.

Palestinians live under difficult conditions. In Gaza, 2+ million people are stuck with limited resources. In the West Bank, Palestinians face checkpoints, military rule, and Jewish settlements expanding.

Hamas (in Gaza) attacks Israel with rockets or raids into Israeli towns and cities, some but not all are successfully intercepted by the Iron Dome (Israel’s missile defence system). Ones that don’t injure and kill civilians. 
Being at war, Israel responds with heavy bombings and blockades. Civilians — especially Palestinians in Gaza — suffer the most.

On October 7, 2023, Hamas fighters broke through the border, attacking Israeli communities. They killed over 1,000 civilians and took more than 200 hostages into Gaza.
- Other times, there have been stabbings, shootings, or suicide bombings targeting buses, markets, or cafes in Israel.

After attacks like October 7, 2023, Israel launched a massive military campaign in Gaza.
- This included airstrikes, artillery, and ground operations.
- While Israel says it targets Hamas fighters and infrastructure, because Gaza is so densely populated, thousands of civilians have been killed, homes destroyed, and basic services (water, electricity, hospitals) badly damaged.

—— 

Hamas is a political party and military organisation who:
- Their stated goal is to liberate all of historic Palestine and destroy the state of Israel.
- They see this as both a nationalist and religious duty: the land is considered Islamic holy land, and Israel is viewed as occupying it.

- Has the support of half of the Palestinians in Gaza (2023 Poll). Currently, the number is questionable and media (and your algorithms) may have controlled the narrative that you believe. 
- Has spent millions of dollars on building tunnels underground
- Palestinians are secondary to militant spending. Gaza’s 2+ million people suffer from electricity shortages, water crises, destroyed hospitals, and poverty because that money isn’t invested in infrastructure, healthcare, or jobs.
- Does not always wear uniform to distinguish themselves from civilians as a tactic (which adds to civilian casualties.)
- Even when foreign aid is sent for civilian use, it can be redirected, taxed, or mismanaged before reaching ordinary people.

——-

Israel has a highly organized, modern defense system aimed at protecting civilians and deterring attacks.
- They rely on mandatory military service, advanced tech, and intelligence.
- Their military actions, while defensive in purpose, often lead to high civilian casualties in Gaza, which fuels criticism.

While Hamas has taken civilians and soldiers as leverage, sometimes for prisoner swaps or political demands, Israel holds combatants (military or militant prisoners) but not ordinary civilians.

——————

If Israel loses this fight, chaos and struggle among Islamic groups (Hamas, other militias) will likely occur in the fight for control. Palestinians will continue to suffer unrest under the regime that has not prioritised civilian welfare. 

Hamas idea of success = Israel wiped off the map, everyone is under Sharia Law, including Jews. 

Successful Islamic militant groups have shown this in parts of Afghanistan under Taliban, Sudan in the 1990s, or Iran after 1979. Strict Sharia regimes (like Taliban Afghanistan or parts of Sudan historically) often struggle with poverty, corruption, and economic isolation. Women’s rights = Gone, Child Marriages = Allowed, LGBTQ+ = Dead. Other Religions = Dead / Oppressed to Convert. 

Can they become like other majority Muslim countries like UAE, Qatar (prosperous, hybrid Sharia / secular states)? 

Unlikely, due to their lack of natural resources in Palestine and Israel (like UAE/Qatar), they would need to allow foreign investment, and women in the workforce. Islamic radical rule (if Hamas takes over) historically has never established stable governance, freedom to run businesses and trade internationally. 

Israel’s biggest “resource” is its people and technology sector.
It has a thriving tech industry, defense sector, and high-skilled workforce, which drives its economy. 
Will Hamas equip Palestinians with what they need to have better living conditions if the skilled Israeli population is gone?

———

I am not sure with this all in mind whether Israel will be able to eliminate Hamas completely as even with a massive defeat, they will rebuild over time. Their leaders are very wealthy people. 

Ordinary Palestinians may continue to live in a state of unrest and poverty, as they have been for decades.

These comments confused me… israel has levelled Gaza. Gaza has not merely suffered isolated destruction… it has been systematically levelled. The scale of ruin, targeting of civilian infrastructure, mass displacement, and staggering death toll make it one of the most physically devastated regions in any modern conflict.

So why do people keep saying Israel is moral and has practised restraint? 

Gaza has been overwhelmingly devastated. Satellite imagery and on-the-ground analysis reveal a landscape all but razed:

More than 290,000 to 436,000 housing units—up to 92% of homes—have been damaged or destroyed, displacing almost the entire population

Nearly 60–70% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or severely damaged since October 2023, according to AP, Al Jazeera, and UN satellite assessments

Infrastructure damage is extensive: over 60% of roads and nearly 70% of farmlands are ruined, 95–100% of schools, and around half of hospitals have been damaged or destroyed

Entire towns, such as Khuza’a, have been subjected to methodical, non-combat zone demolition—described by Amnesty as “a chilling testament to Israel’s ongoing campaign of systematic destruction” 

As of mid-2025, over 56,000 Palestinians—predominantly civilians—have been killed, with the territory left covered in rubble, lacking essential services, and facing a humanitarian and reconstruction crisis estimated at $50 billion, with rubble removal alone expected to take years to decades

Every day, I see videos on Hamas’ Telegram showing them sniping soldiers, blowing up tanks with RPGs, or conducting tunnel operations. Some videos even demonstrate direct communication between battalions through landlines in the tunnels.

How is Hamas able to regroup so easily? And how are they staying stocked with weapons for this long despite the occupation? It’s fascinating and puzzling to think about how they’re maintaining this level of resistance.

What’s even more puzzling to me is how the US continues to pour billions of dollars into supporting the IDF, and yet they’re still having such a tough time fighting a guerilla group that doesn’t even have an air force.

If a ""token"" is a person who has non-representative viewpoints for their respective identity group and who is elevated for political purposes to neutralize accusations of bigotry, then about 20-30 years AIPAC's candidate recruitment in the US has revolved around tokenism, [as they openly admit.](https://theintercept.com/2023/09/21/aipac-cbc-progressive-black-democrats/) In their program of targeting Black politicians, who represent a community that increasingly opposes Israel, *AIPAC states that they try to deploy Black candidates who are the rare pro-Israel supporters.* What's more, since 10/7, [pro-Israel accounts have been made cringeworthy attempts to find virtually any POC who supports Israel.](https://imgur.com/a/PqiOdY1) Truly shameless.

Even five years ago, the idea that a Muslim who denounces Israeli war crimes, says he would arrest Netanyahu if he came to NYC, and recognizes the human rights of Palestinians could electorally succeed in New York City would be unthinkable.

     I fear that I might be coming to an existential realization of our current situation in society. It’s popping up in both beautiful and horrific thought. I’d like to start with the horrific, and then end with the beautiful.

     Counties are not powerful because they have the largest number of nuclear weapons. They have the nuclear arsenals to control their power.  If they didn’t bolster their toys, they would have to destroy any power that offered open border immigration after warning of the annexation of corrupt governments.  

     How have we all come this far without seeing all of these Old &amp; Tired, Plays &amp; Tricks? Or, are they starting to become so now? That’s what I see every time I watch mainstream media. At least the main stream media they are choosing for me to see. American culture is in shambles, just like its society and infrastructure, to a point far past rationality. Has anyone ever stopped to come to this realization?

     I’m watching Tucker Carlson on the Joe Rogan experience talking about UFO’s. He’s trying every play in his book to take up air time from the younger American audience currently having their rights taken away to view the atrocities taking place on TikTok in the genocide of the Palestinian people. 

     He laughs like that because he wants that to be what people talk about when his name is brought up and not the fact that he’s a propaganda tool trying to relate to his target audience of the baby boomers, grandpas watching Fox News all day…Why is it capitalizing Fox News as I type? God they’re so narcissistically inclined to imbed it everywhere…that’s a joke, I think.

     It seems clear to me that Tucker has studied practices in societal manipulation, and did so because he came to the very arrogant conclusion that what our society needs is more distraction, and what his wallet needs, is to be lined with money. I’m sure there have to be more semi-educated citizen in society watching him crack at the seams. I hope I’m not alone in watching the world going along in this way. 

    There must be more out there that are realizing that our protest strategies are not working fast enough for the Palestinian people and that we must come together for a much larger, strategic plan. We are past the point of standing around on a television screen so others can see, and far past trying to use rationality while we beg for reason. I can no longer tolerate the culpable negligence of our governments corruption. No longer do we hold the values our country once had and no longer should they hold power.

     So much so that it has frustrated me to the point I’ve tired myself with the horrific before getting to tell the beautiful. I’ll share some of that when I’m in a better state of mind to express it, and when my writing hasn’t turned into a rant.  But, Joe did leave a comment about a beautiful Japanese term called Kaizen, that I saved to read after all of this frustration.

1bz5ylu,IsraelPalestine,"Wondering if my understanding of narratives here has inaccurate assumptions These preceding events to Oct. 7 seem to have little noise in many forums:

-            the Saudi deal (normalizing relations with Israel in the Arab world)

-            huge protests pushing Netanyahu out of power (potentially normalizing a transition to power with progressive leaders that could lead to a two-state solution)

-            a less secure Gaza border (soldiers were busy in the West Bank by illegal settlements).

The constant argument is, instead, that Oct 7. being a reaction to 75 years of oppression. Not even that oppression leads to “terrorism” in general, but, rather, specifically, that Oct. 7, was a response to the oppression.

I belieive it's important to split this narrative into two – that Oct. 7 specifically is not a response to 75 years of oppression, however oppression leads to more chance of terrorism.

**Oct 7 is not one blanket “75 years of oppression.”**

1.        First, by applying a blanket statement, it’s pretty much asking for circular arguments about dates and events and who owns the right to the land. It shines on the 1940s but tends to to ignore ~~that post-1967 Jews were not safe in their Arab countries.~~  Jews in Arab countries had to leave throughout the late 40s to late 50s (about 90% of the population)\* Even if you blame Israel 100% for this, it doesn’t change the fact that the Jews had to leave, and Israel was the place they could go to escape persecution. There are now millions of Jews who cannot return home, and many that want peace. It overshadows that orthodox jewish settlers that make of Netanyahu's coalition and Hamas are both committed to preventing peace, instigating each other. It ignores the wars that were fought on defensive, which circles into questioning whether it was defensive or offensive and so on\*

2.        Second, as mentioned, this overscores the facts that preceding the Oct 7 attack:

a.        The lack of security because of increased presence in illegal settlements. Tying Oct 7 specifically to retaliation for illegal settlements in the West Bank and their policing would give something to barter with, and grant weight for an argument for retaliation. If Israel can retaliate Oct 7, can’t Palestine retaliate the increase of aggression by the illegal settlements? This opens more doors than “Can Palestine retaliate the existence of Israel on their land,” A point many don’t want to settle on, but one which will just lead to nonstop conflict. Would this not open more opportunity for a ceasefire, as it exposes a never-ending tit-for-tat?

b.       The Saudi-deal + protests to get Bibi out of power. Normalizing relations between the Arab world and Israel, while also calling for a progressive leader meant getting close to the possibility of a two-state solution. Understanding that Hamas doesn’t want this, and many Israelis and Palestinians do, means accepting that Hamas actions were not about oppression but about maintaining control. They don’t want Israel as a legitimate state and would rather risk Gaza, as they have, than have Palestine to become a state alongside Israel.

These potential contributors to a two-state solution, negotiation, diplomacy and peace should not be erased.

**Any number of years of oppression will increase terrorism, instability, and security risks. The oppressor and the oppressed are both corrupted.**

1.        First, exposing cause and effect protects from propaganda. How many saw a terrorist attack and deemed all Palestinians as terrorists? The narrative that terrorism increases from instability, oppression, and inequality over decades is much more effective then picking a specific terrorist attack (Oct 7) and linking it directly, which pushes people to support whoever will protect them from Oct 7. instead of making excuses, rather than understanding that the best course of action is those who don't inflame disparate conditions and lack of self-determination.

2.        Second, this allows for Israel to be open minded to reparations that can help rebuild after the horrors of on-going war on Gaza. The narrative that more blood could come by leaving Palestinians alone to pick up crumbles of bombs dropped by Israel means more chance of Israeli aid.

3.        Third, that further weighs the importance of a two-state solution. Having autonomy, self-determination, and dignity are the opposite of the building blocks of terrorism. Why would Hamas want a two-state solution if it means no recruitment? Why would Bibi want a two-state solution if it means no more ultra-authoritarian leadership in Israel?

4.        Fourth, this is a strong argument for an IMMEDIATE and lasting ceasefire. Because it exposes that there is no elimination of terrorism or Hamas by the means that creates it.

5.        Lastly, this means stronger calls for progressive Israeli leadership.

18e8swk,IsraelPalestine,"I'm sick of people thinking Israelis are all the same. Pre October 7th Israel was on the brink of a civil war because of how many people were againt the current government. There were huge protests of thousands of people for 35 weeks straight that stopped the whole country at times, just because of how unethical this government is and how it only became that way so Netanyahu can escape prison.

 Now because the country is in active war it looks like people forgot about it while talking about Israel fron the outside, while in Israel a lot of the online discussion is about how this government is made out of the least qualified people for the job.
Yet it's impossible to hold elections while fighting.
It's quite like ripping the condom mid act without having an option to pull out.

I have heard of a horrible news from Netanyahu who threatened Hamas to seize lands of Gaza if they do not release the hostages.

I have also learned that people have been displaced right after the creation of an Israeli state.

I was wondering if they can ever have the chance to have the Galilean villages, Eilat village, Haifa village and Jaffa village.  

But after the first Israeli-Arab war, the situation has went worse; seizing the UN partition land and leave only 1967 lines.

The people rejected the UN partition plan cause they wanted the lands from where their villages were after being depopulated.

1may2jm,IsraelPalestine,"Israel Says It Has Paused Some Military Activity in Gaza. How does this change the situation in Gaza? Israel said it paused military activity in parts of Gaza on Sunday to allow in international aid, amid growing outrage over the severe hunger faced by Palestinians in the territory.

The decision was a reversal by Israel that followed growing pressure over the dire conditions in Gaza, where nearly one in three people has not been eating “for multiple days in a row,” according to the World Food Program, an arm of the United Nations.

Many countries, including some of Israel’s traditional allies, blame Israel for the widespread hunger crisis. The Israeli government blocked almost all aid to Gaza from March through May in an effort to squeeze concessions from Hamas, and has restricted aid deliveries into the territory since then.

The Israeli military said that as part of the policy change that began on Sunday, Israeli forces would pause operations daily in at least three parts of Gaza from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. to allow aid to enter. It added that they would also designate secure routes for U.N. convoys to deliver aid between specified hours. (Click the link to see the rest).

US incorporated Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) started distributing aid today. If Gazans carrying the aid parcel got robbed while walking back to their family, who will you blame ? Would you blame the robber ? Or would you blame someone else, who ? And why ?

Each aid parcel has 50 meals to feed an entire family (idk how many days of food is that, probably several days). I am going to assume, they will try to their hardest to keep their food parcel safe and not get robbed, because his entire family depends on him to get them food.

The show must go on. The former Executive Director Jake Wood has announced his resignation. The new acting Executive Director is John Acree. According to his profile which was part of Witkoff's presentation to the UN Security Council. The only thing that catches my eye was USAID. Anyways, at least someone has stepped up and temporary leading the humanitarian efforts. Someone is better than nobody in charged.

&gt;John Acree is a senior humanitarian practitioner with more than two decades of global field experience in disaster response, stabilization programming, and civil-military coordination. John spent a significant portion of his career with USAID’s Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), including deployments to conflict-affected regions as part of Disaster Assistance Response Teams (DART). He has coordinated logistics and relief operations during complex emergencies—including active war zones and natural disasters—working closely with host governments, UN agencies, and local NGOs

There is still alot of opposition by UN, UNRWA and big humanitarian organizations against the US incorporated Gaza Humanitarian Foundation and the new delivery system. The UN, UNRWA and many big hunanitarian organizations has refused to participate, cooperate or assist. Hence you will see lesser known NGO, or private charity organizations etc..which dont care about politics but are solely focus on feeding people cooperate with Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.

A small number of lesser-known organizations have agreed to cooperate with the GHF thus far, including the US-based aid group Rahma Worldwide, whose logo is seen in the photos of boxes being distributed to Gazans today. In Arabic the word Rahma can be translated to mercy or compassion. It's a US- based muslim NGO. 

We are not out of the woods yet. It's not clear how many people GHF is feeding. No official figures were released.

**What do the Palestinians want?**  
  
""The withdrawal of many, if not all, settler communities on the West Bank; a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem; the reconstruction of Gaza; and security and governance arrangements for a combined West Bank and Gaza.""  
  
Over 400,000 Israelis lose their homes. Israel, which currently has all of Jerusalem, loses much of it. Israel has to reconstruct Gaza, which I believe is estimated at $50 billion. If there is any violence that comes from the West Bank, it would be impossible for Israel to defend against it. Tel Aviv, for example, is only 32 miles from the West Bank. And Jerusalem is quite literally next to it. Cutting off northern Israel would be incredibly easy to do.   
  
**What do Israelis wantt?**  
  
""The hope is that Israel would also be offered specific security guarantees and normalization with Saudi Arabia and other Arab states.""  
  
And “the most important power that has to remain in Israel’s hands,” \[Netanyahu\] said, “is overriding security control in the area west of the Jordan” river. ""



That is from the article. If anyone else has a list of Israeli demands beyond that, please share.

  
**How to make this work?**  
  
Peace can only be achieved when both sides have something that they can accept. From my layman reading of this, both sides have pretty much said what they want. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as their capital, they want Israel completely out of the West Bank, and they want tens of billions of dollars in reconstruction money.  
  
Israel wants safety from Palestinian attacks. Not promises. But actual, enforceable safety.   
  
**My own ""modest"" proposal**  
  
Beersheba in Southern Israel used to me an Arab town (I believe, correct me if I am wrong). It is now 1/2 Jewish 1/2 Arab. It is the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in Israel, the eighth-most populous Israeli city. Palestine, as a nation, gets to have territory that goes from Ramallah and Jericho in the north, with East Jerusalem as their capital, and stretches from the West Bank to Gaza, with their northern border being south of Qiryat Gat, and thus it would encompass Beersheba. The embargo by Israel ends. Neither side has any military presence in each other's territory. I

  
This gives Israel and Palestine both land that goes from the River to the Sea. Both nations get Jerusalem. Both have large relocations of citizens...but it gives both large and continuous swathes of territory, that includes access to the Sea. Neither side has land that is easily cut off from the rest of it.  
  
In addition to this, Israel does indeed pay $50 billion (or whatever is agreed upon). This is in addition to any international aid that Palestine gets. However, it is spread out in payments that go over a decade. And the amount of money paid is decreased every time that rockets and/or terrorist attacks come from Palestine. Israel has the costly Iron Dome system that intercepts each rocket. Under this plan, the Palestinian leadership would have a real reason to police their own and to stop terrorist groups from attacking Israel. Each and every such attack would hurt their bottom line. And given how infamous Palestinian leadership is for embezzling money, it would certainly hurt their own pockets. If Palestinians keep firing tens of thousands of rockets? That money would quickly dry up to $0.  
  
So, you end up with two nations that have borders which make sense. Both sides lose something. Both sides gain something. Now, I know that this won't happen. And I know that this idea is just the musings of someone with no personal skin in the game. But it is my attempt at meeting the demands of both parties.  
  
With all of that said, I'd be interested as to what others believe could be done which meet the demands of both sides?",,
1nqsu4w,IsraelPalestine,"I visited Gaza. The food aid surprised me. 
I recently returned from Gaza, where I witnessed the humanitarian catastrophe that has resulted from Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The crisis defies comparison to anything I have encountered in nearly four decades of responding to disasters in more than 100 countries. Governance has collapsed, routes are dangerous, and people are suffering immensely.

The main provider of food assistance in the Gaza Strip today arguably is the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, an organization backed by the United States and Israel. GHF has faced harsh criticism for its work in Gaza, with United Nations agencies and nongovernmental organizations publishing a letter in July urging donors and countries not to fund the foundation’s work and to instead revert to a solely U.N.-led response. I arrived in Gaza a skeptic of GHF but left an advocate. Simply put, the common portrayal of this organization radically distorts reality.

I observed GHF’s relief operations firsthand. What I saw was not a textbook distribution — because no textbook exists for a war zone such as Gaza, where terrorist combatants hide among civilians. Instead, I saw GHF using unconventional means to successfully deliver food to civilians on a staggering scale under nearly impossible circumstances. It wasn’t perfect, but it was good.

Many of GHF’s staff are former military personnel. They travel in armored vehicles, maintain security protocols and are provided needed access by the Israel Defense Forces. GHF’s critics see this as inappropriate militarization of humanitarian aid. I see it as realistic.

Relative to most other aid distributions around the world, GHF’s job is especially dangerous, requiring tenacity and elaborate planning from people who know how to conduct themselves calmly in a volatile setting. In crowds that can number in the tens of thousands, potentially infiltrated by Hamas terrorists, steady leadership and situational control are essential. 

I watched GHF teams, along with their Palestinian staffs, manage huge crowds with total professionalism. IDF shooting incidents have tragically cost some Gazans their lives as they seek aid, but Israel investigates these episodes and acknowledges mistakes. Civilian deaths reflect the sad reality of war, not Israeli policy.

The scale of the crisis in Gaza, combined with the sheer difficulty and unpredictability of the crowds, demands embracing extraordinary models of humanitarian assistance. This process is beyond the abilities of a traditional humanitarian organization accustomed to using entrenched protocols.

U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said recently, when discussing Gaza, that “we are seeing the last gasp of a humanitarian system built on humanitarian principles.” This view is rooted in the perspective that the U.N. is the only body capable of leading a principled humanitarian response in Gaza. The message is not helpful. If we are serious about humanitarian principles, we must start with the first one: saving lives and reducing suffering — even if it means abandoning traditional methods that didn’t work in this setting.

There is no way to revert, as the U.N. has suggested, to the distribution systems used for humanitarian aid in Gaza before the Oct. 7 slaughter. It isn’t possible because the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA, is no longer allowed to operate in Gaza after Israel found that many of its staff were members of Hamas and/or participants in the Oct. 7 attack.

Despite the challenges of working in such a dramatically changed landscape, GHF is putting food into the hands of hungry people, noting that it has distributed more than 167 million meals to date, and preventing Hamas from exerting control over the Gaza food supply. Meanwhile, the U.N.’s own statistics show that 82 percent of its trucks entering Gaza in August were “intercepted” — looted — “either peacefully by hungry people or forcefully by armed actors.”

The people of Gaza would be better served by the U.N. coordinating with GHF to expand the delivery of humanitarian assistance effectively. There are practical steps that the U.N. can take to engage with the organization, including acknowledging the need for armed escorts of food convoys within Gaza. The Inter-Agency Standing Committee of the U.N. and its partners have long-established guidelines for the use of armed escorts for humanitarian convoys as a “last resort.” Don’t the people of Gaza meet the necessary conditions? The U.N. has used armed escorts for humanitarian aid in Somalia, Haiti and many other countries.

Last month, several U.N. representatives met privately with a GHF official to discuss coordinating the Gaza aid effort. This is a promising sign. Feeding desperate people should not be a rivalrous competition.
What is needed: less ideology and more courage; less bureaucratic sclerosis and more moral clarity. Don’t let the pursuit of humanitarian perfection become the enemy of the practical good.

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a UN-backed global hunger monitor, has officially declared a famine in Gaza City and its surrounding areas.  This marks the first confirmed famine in the Middle East, and it's entirely man-made.  Over half a million people—about a quarter of Gaza's population—are facing catastrophic hunger, with that number expected to rise to over 640,000 by the end of September.  

The famine is a direct result of Israel's 22-month-long military offensive, which has led to severe food shortages, destroyed infrastructure, and restricted humanitarian aid.  The UN and aid organizations have condemned Israel's actions, stating that the famine could have been prevented if access for humanitarian aid had been allowed.  

Despite these findings, Israel has dismissed the famine declaration as politically motivated and based on false information.  However, independent experts and humanitarian organizations emphasize that the famine is real and devastating.  

This is a humanitarian crisis that demands our attention and action.  The people of Gaza are suffering, and it's our responsibility to stand in solidarity with them.  We must call for an immediate ceasefire, unrestricted humanitarian access, and accountability for those responsible for this atrocity. 

I've heard ""Israel is targeting Hamas, not civilians.""

The famine is a result of actions that have indiscriminately affected civilians, including the destruction of food infrastructure and restrictions on aid. 


The IPC is a neutral body that includes over a dozen UN agencies and independent experts. 


While some aid has entered, it is insufficient and often blocked or delayed, exacerbating the crisis. The situation in Gaza is dire and cannot be ignored.  This is not just a political issue; it's a human rights issue.  We must amplify the voices of those suffering and demand action from our leaders.

1irk3y0,IsraelPalestine,"So it seems Israel has been using Palestinians as human shields... Again 
An investigation revealed that Israeli soldiers from the Nahal Brigade used an 80-year-old Palestinian man as a human shield in Gaza City. They tied an explosive command wire around his neck and forced him to check houses for booby traps. After eight hours, he and his wife were told to evacuate to a “safe zone,” but due to a lack of coordination, another IDF unit shot and killed them.

The incident highlights contradictions in Israel’s claims about human shields. While Israel accuses Hamas of using civilians to protect fighters, the IDF itself has used vulnerable Palestinians to shield its troops. The failure to protect evacuees, the disregard for Palestinian lives, and the lack of accountability suggest systemic issues within the IDF.

Investigations by groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have found no conclusive evidence that Hamas deliberately forces civilians to act as human shields. While Hamas operates in civilian areas, this does not legally constitute human shielding. Meanwhile, Israel’s actions raise serious ethical and legal concerns, as they mirror the very tactics they condemn.

Edit:

To people who think this is a one case thing or it's not a common practice by IDF

The use of Palestinians as human shields by Israeli Defense Forces has been documented by human rights organizations including Human Rights Watch, B'Tselem and Amnesty International

1dmjyl8,IsraelPalestine,"People can receive self determination at the expense of their minority populations, but Jews can’t? Historically I haven’t liked the sarcastic “so only Jews don’t get self determination?” argument because I thought it ignored important factors like HOW self determination is achieved. 

But we can justify Jewish self determination in Palestine without even bringing European Jewish immigrants into the picture. 

Let’s look at this as the percentage of Jews in the Ottoman Empire and the land area they should receive as a state. Hopefully I don’t have to argue why the Jews of the Ottoman Empire should receive a state at all. 

The TLDR of the calculations is that in 1905, the Jewish population percentage in the Ottoman Empire (minus the first Aliyah) was 1.06%.

The percentage of the Jewish partition of Mandate Palestine out of the whole Ottoman Empire was .78%.

You can find the calculations indented at the end of the post. I hope I have my numbers right, but please correct me if I don’t. 

No population wants to find itself under the sovereignty of another nation’s state. I get it. 410k Palestinians would have been living under Jewish sovereignty under the UN’s 1947 partition plan. 

But the alternative was for the Jews to live under the sovereignty of another nation’s state too. By 1947, there were 500k Jews in Mandate Palestine, and 1.2m Jews (inclusive) across the Ottoman Empire. But if you wanted to exclude the Jewish population of Palestine, you’d still end up with 700k Jews. 700k Jews without self determination vs 410k Palestinians who could move to most of the Ottoman Empire and find like-minded people to self-determine with. Or literally move just across the border to join the rest of the Palestinians. Or stay in Israel if they’d like. It’s not like Israel was going to make them second class citizens if they accepted the state. 

You can justify why the Palestinians were unhappy with all this, but I don’t think you can effectively argue that they were receiving the bigger injustice out of all the options. This was what was happening. People were self determining. 

To argue that Jews shouldn’t have received a state is to argue that other groups can receive self determination at the expense of minority populations, but Jews cannot receive self determination at the expense of minority populations. And worse, the Jews in this case only had one chance at self determination. The Palestinians had many. 

**Calculations:**

&gt; The area  of the Ottoman Empire was 1.8m square km. 

&gt; The area of Jewish partition of Mandate Palestine was 

&gt; 25.6k * 55% = 14.08k sq km

&gt; Now, the Jewish partition of Mandate Palestine as a percentage of the Ottoman Empire is:

&gt; 14.08k / 1.8m = .78%

&gt; The population of the Ottoman Empire in 1905 was 20.9m.

&gt; The Jewish population of the Ottoman Empire in 1905 was 256k. If we want to subtract the European immigrants, we’ll subtract the numbers from the first Aliyah, 35k. This leaves 221k.

&gt; The Jewish population percentage is

&gt; 221k / 20.9m = 1.06%",,

In Gaza, prior to Oct 7, Israel imposed a siege on Gaza and restricted people from travelling without Israeli permission. All the civil services like water and electricity were heavily restricted. Israel had access to all Palestinians home addresses, population data, telecommunication services etc. All the while being heavily surveilled. Israel literally counted the caloric intake of Palestinians.

This in turn sealed Gaza off from the rest of the world, with an economy on the brink of collapse. It also turns out that this was a deliberate part of Israeli strategy.

Not to mention, Israel also deliberately bolstered Hamas, in an attempt to destabilize the Palestinians as part of a divide and conquer strategy.

And this is already awful, but the West Bank in many ways resembles a more dystopian novel. 

In the West Bank, checkpoints are deliberately installed to make basic living conditions for Palestinians unbearable. The neighbourhoods are so heavily surveilled, Israel uses biometric cameras to constantly observe Palestinians everywhere they go.

Palestinians can have their homes invaded at any time. And even their social media is 
inspected for wrongthink. So they never have any privacy in their lives. Furthermore, Israel routinely detains Palestinians, including children, often without charge or trial without even charging them with a crime. And there is systemic torture and abuse in Israeli detention facilities, with numerous reported casualties and **captured footage of the rape of detainees, which resulted in riots defending the rapists**

One would expect that anyone genuinely concerned with Palestinian welfare would be thrilled to see a concerted effort to deliver aid directly to Gazans and securing that aid against looting by Hamas. Instead, MSF and other prominent ""humanitarian"" NGOs call for its dismantlement. Why? Precisely because it disintermediates Hamas from the aid distribution.

Israel is sacrificing its own blood and treasure to feed the Gazan civilians who overwhelmingly support the destruction of the Jewish state, applauded the October 7th massacre and who unanimously refuse to assist in freeing Israeli hostages. How is Israel rewarded for its altruism?

&gt;This system is a slaughter masquerading as humanitarian aid, and it must be immediately dismantled. Aid must not be controlled by a warring party to further its military objectives.

Their central argument was that the Rohingya were being subjected “to a subsistence diet, systematic expulsion from homes, and the induction of essential medical services below minimum requirement”.

The UK submission on Myanmar argues there is a lower threshold for determining genocide if the damage has been inflicted on children as opposed to adults. The submission said other actions that could be defined as genocidal, if systematic, include forced displacement from homes, deprivation of medical services, and the imposition of subsistence diets.

It argues that given declarations of intent to commit genocide are rare, the court’s test should not solely be explicit statements or numbers killed, but reasonable inference drawn from a pattern of conduct and factual evidence.

But none of these Western states is backing South Africa’s submission to the same court - even though conditions in Gaza engineered by Israel are even worse? Double standards?

South Africa is likely to highlight the UK’s arguments about Myanmar, submitted in conjunction with Canada, Germany, Denmark, France, and the Netherlands, when it makes its accusation against Israel.

The November joint submission against Myanmar was in support of an original application made to the ICJ by The Gambia in November 2019.

The ICJ unanimously accepted The Gambia’s request for provisional measures in December 2020 and issued a legally binding order to Myanmar to end its genocidal acts and report to the court on the steps it was taking to comply.

With Israel having an iron dome their attempts at genocide are not successful and see some people pointing to genocide as something being successfully done. 

From the other side  I’ve heard arguments from the other side saying Israel has the power to do one Hamas doesn’t because they just have guns and cheap homemade rockets. Israel has really powerful guns and they’re capable of carrying out a genocide whereas Hamas doesn’t have the capability of carrying out a genocide. Other analogies I’ve heard is the comparison to Hitler where during Nazi Germany Hitler didn’t successfully genocide the Jews even though there was an attempt at doing so.  

In my opinion, even though the iron dome protects Israeli civilians pretty well Hamas is still trying to genocide Israelis with the rockets, and the stabbings, suicide bombs of Israeli civilians.

I was somewhat surprised when I learned that many of the Zionists in the 40s were socialists/communists, and that a socialist party was in charge for several decades after Israel was founded.

The Soviet Union was a major arms supplier for Israel when it was founded, and the Egyptian declaration of war included the phrase ""against communist atheism and nihilism"".

People love talking about the history of the last century when discussing the conflict, but this rarely if ever comes up. 

Why? I‘m guessing it’s because it doesn’t really fit into any side‘s narrative. The pro-Palestine left doesn't want to admit that Israel was run by leftists (since that would implicate them), and the pro-Israel right doesn't want to taint Zionism (which they like) with socialism (which they don't like). But it's not a clean left-right divide by any means, so this explanation doesn't fully work. 

Why aren't western leftists calling for the workers in both Israel and Palestine to rise up against Netanyahu, Hamas, and Fatah and create a secular workers' state? I would have thought this would be the logical communist/socialist position. 

I can understand people saying the current government is right-wing, ethno-nationalist etc., but to claim it was always the case seems rather ahistorical. From what I understand, Mapai even founded sister parties to ensure ethnic minority representation. I'm not saying socialists can't also be imperialist, but it seems kinda weird that anti-Israel people consistently claim it was a colonial project from the beginning.

Also, I would argue that the largely successful integration of the Arab-Israelis, Druze and other minorities (which many pro-Israel people like to point out) is an achievement of the socialists who were in power during that time. 

Another question: why has the socialist party (or its continuation in form of the Labour Party) shrunk to such a tiny size? They seem fairly decent in comparison to the others. In fact I think the Israeli opposition, especially the left, are a key to solving the conflict, or at least reducing its intensity.

They were united under a single banner and although the desires of the ethnic majority were prioritised, its ethnic minority lived well enough. In the 1900s, these peoples were split and the minority ethnic group celebrated their independence.

The majority ethnic group wished to reclaim the entirety of its territory and initiated a series of bloody wars against its neighbour. They believe the territory should be unified as a stepping stone to defeating their ultimate enemy: the West. 

Russia has spent two years trying to force a one-state solution on the people of Ukraine. Such a solution would force Ukrainians to give up their self-determination and suffer under the boot of Russian authoritarianism. 

Israel, like Ukraine, had not been independent in the hundreds of years before its founding. Its independence reflected the desires of a long oppressed ethnic group finally taking control of its political destiny. Now, like Ukraine, it fights an enemy intent on robbing it of its self-determination.

Ukraine’s conflict with Russia and Israel’s with Hamas cannot be solved with a one-state solution. Such a solution would, at the very least, lead to the oppression and forced assimilation of Ukrainians and Israelis. Unless their authoritarian neighbours give up their expansionist desires, Ukraine and Israel have no choice but to defend themselves against those who seek their subjugation. 

A one-state solution is seldom recommended to end the war in Ukraine or other similar ethnic conflicts (Armenia/Azerbaijan comes to mind), yet it’s often suggested for I/P. Why do you think that is? Do you think Israelis could be compelled to agree to such a solution?

As an alternative option, imagine if Palestinians were encouraged to accept a one-state solution between Gaza and Egypt. Do you think they would agree?

1awtx9j,IsraelPalestine,"Questions for pro-Israelis about the 1920s and pro-Palestinians about the 2020s Sometimes I imagine an Arab living in Mandatory Palestine in the 1920s. Perhaps they feel some sympathy for the persecution the Jews fled and perhaps they have some understanding of the strong historical and religious connection the Jews have with the land of Israel. Perhaps they didn’t have a problem with the first and second waves of aliyah, when the number of Jewish immigrants was relatively small and their aims were unclear.

However, after the Balfour Declaration and the third and fourth waves it would have become quite clear to this Arab that the Jews were not just trying to migrate, but to become the majority and start their own country. If I were that Arab I would have been very upset about the prospect of becoming a minority, even if I knew for certain (which of course they couldn’t) that I would be afforded full rights in this new state. I also would have been very opposed to moving somewhere else to accomodate the Jews. Why should I have to leave?

What I am saying is that I completely understand why the local Arab population fiercely opposed the Zionists and felt a lot of anger towards them. A question for the pro-Zionists - can you see that perspective? How do you think you would have felt in that situation?

However it is now approximately 100 years later. While I can understand the Arab violent opposition to the creation of Israel that started in the 1920s, I don’t understand how people can continue to support violently opposing the existence of Israel a century later. 

Is it fair that the Palestinians have to share the land that was once wholly controlled by fellow Muslims? I don’t know. But I do know that what’s done is done and the dream of a Palestinian state from the river to the sea is a completely delusional one.

Israel is a top 20 military power, a top 30 economic power and is closely allied with the most powerful nation on earth. Its 8 million Jewish citizens are clearly not going to voluntary migrate to the country of their great grandparents (or even earlier ancestors), especially when you consider that for high proportion of them that country would be a middle eastern one that refuses to take them in. Israelis have lived through a century of war and terrorism, another 20 October 7s won’t convince millions to leave. 

So what is the alternative? Surely you don’t propose rectifying what you see as an injustice through mass expulsion? Through murder? 

Maybe you think there should be a single state that protects the rights of all its citizens. Can you honestly say that if you were a Jewish Israeli you would be comfortable with that? Living in a country where a high proportion of your fellow citizens are antisemitic and want you dead? Knowing the persecution that Jews living in other Arab countries have faced? Seems like a huge risk to take. I know I wouldn’t want to take it. A single state solution may be possible one day in the very distant future but I think you have to be very naive to think it would work any time soon given the hatred felt by both sides.

So what does Palestinian violence do now other than make the only possible solution - a two state one - less likely? You may think that Netanyahu and his right wing nationalist coalition members are never going to support a two state solution. Maybe you are right. But Begin made peace with Egypt, Rabin made peace with Jordan, Netanyahu signed the Wye River Memorandum and Barak agreed to the 2000 Camp David proposal. There were times when a majority of Israelis supported the Oslo peace process. Whatever you think of who was to blame for the failure of this process, Palestinian terrorism only makes it less likely that there will ever be a negotiated peace. More likely that Israelis vote for those who build settlements and make coexistence harder to achieve.

So those who justify or ‘contextualise’ October 7 and all the many, many terrorist attacks before it, what is your long term solution and how do these terrorist attacked further that solution?

1kx679n,IsraelPalestine,"Do you think 100,000 IDF soldiers are somehow committing genocide without knowing it? In genocides, soldiers know that they are trying to mass murder civilians. In Rwanda, soldiers were given lists of Tutsi families and their addresses and would walk inside schools, churches, and homes, looking for those civilians to murder. They knew they were going after civilians, not soldiers. During the Armenian genocide, Ottoman soldiers marched thousands of Armenian civilians into the desert, frequently shooting them along the way. They knew they were marching civilians, not soldiers. In Bosnia, Serbs rounded up Bosnians, separated the men from the women, bussed 8,000 men to kiling fields, and killed all of them one day. They knew they were doing that. That's what genocidal intent is: knowing you are on a mission to kill civilians.

So, to the present. If the IDF is intentionally attacking civilians, they must know about it, right? That means the soldiers on the ground must know that they receiving orders to target civilians, rather than avoiding killing civilians and targeting militants. The soldiers choosing bomb targets must know they are looking for and aiming at random civilian residences rather than at Hamas targets. It's the low-level, on the ground soldiers who choose targets and aim guns and pull triggers.

And yet, if you ask IDF soldiers — not one of them seems aware that they have be given any orders like that. Instead, they remember being trained not to do that. They go out into the field on missions to capture militants. They walk past homes that are not related to militant targets. They shoot their guns when they think they think they have encountered a militant.

So how do the people claiming genocide think this is working, exactly? Do they think 100,000 soldiers, who are regular Israelis, some of whom do not want to be serving, are all in a mass conspiracy where all of them are somehow keeping a secret that they are actually following orders to kill Palestinian civilians?

When I hear accusations of genocide, I see people posting politician quotes that use dehumanizaing language about Palestinians. That's very rude, but for it to be a genocide, that has to translate into actual policy. The politician who says Palestinians are all very bad needs to actually go and direct his general to tell soldiers to march door to door, looking for civilians to kill.

1eujyhj,IsraelPalestine,"Iran and Hezbollah chicken out?  Several weeks ago, Israel took out several high ranking members of Hamas and Hezbollah, most notably Ismail Haniyeh in Iran and Fuad Shukr.

Since then, there's been a lot of speculation that Iran and Hezbollah would retaliate like they did back in April when Israel took out several Iranian generals in Syria. Given the April attack was of comparable size relative to the initial Russian missile barrage on Ukraine, there was and continues to be concern that Iran will fire a lot of ordinance.

Most commentators seemed to predict that Tisha B'av would be the day that Iran fired missiles, but that day quietly came and went. Iran striking on Tisha B'av would have lined up with the previous pattern of how these terrorist groups would seek to disturb Jewish holidays.

To me, it increasingly looks like it was all thankfully saber rattling. There are a potential few reasons for this:

-Israel had displayed an impressive show of force throughout July and early August. Their intelligence is so good that Israel knows Hezbollah better than Hezbollah knows Hezbollah, and this creates paranoia among terrorist groups.

-Biden saying ""[Don't](https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-814166)"" again actually worked! We're saved!

-Iran finally listened to international law, and agreed that retaliating for Ismail Haniyeh would not have been legal in any way.

-There is some secret communication in diplomatic back channels that was able to discourage a response.

-Iran hesitating to piss off Arab countries who don't want Iranian missiles in their airspace.

-Maybe Iran is planning the attack, and is taking more time to do so.

The best situation that I could think is comparable to the one facing Israel now would be the Cuban Missile Crisis. In that case, neither the Soviet Union or US wanted a full blown war and a similar calculus seems to be taking place between Israel and Iran in terms of avoiding a regional war.",,

I just couldn’t help but notice many times, across many platforms, Daniel Levy is brought out as an authority on the conflict and he’s described as an Israeli negotiator for past Israeli Prime Ministers from 20 years ago. 

Who is Daniel Levy? I can’t find much about him besides his basic résumé that he was an Israeli negotiator (of what?) for PM Rabin and PM Barak. I’d be curious to get an Israeli point of view. I ask because Mr. Levy appears to be extremely biased towards the Palestinians (which is fine) but he presents himself as an Israeli political figure to give himself an air of credibility. It gives the audience the impression of “Wow, Israel is so bad, even Israeli government advisors are criticizing Israel now.”

But from what I can tell, Mr. Levy is so biased, that I’d confuse him for a Hamas-nik if I didn’t know better. He appears to be fairly anti-Israel in general, whose views certainly seem out of the mainstream from an American perspective. The few times he mentions October 7th, he doesn’t seem to care as much about it as the atrocities in Gaza, but it seems he feels he has to mention the October attack occasionally while attacking Israel, to keep the appearance up that he’s a moderate Israeli just telling hard truths that happen to be an indictment against Israel. As an American, I can’t imagine even in polarized times, a government figure from either political party being that openly sympathetic towards an enemy country that attacked America. It would be the end of that person’s credibility and likely career.

It may seem I’m biased towards Israel from my post but I am not. In fact, I’m for an end to the war now. I’m for a tribunal of sorts to examine war crimes committed by both sides.

1hbplr7,IsraelPalestine,"Is Iran Going to Attack Israel? There have been numerous reports, such as those from The Guardian, speculating that Iran might attack Israel during a politically sensitive time, like between the U.S. election and inauguration. However, these predictions were largely made before the Hezbollah ceasefire was announced, potentially altering the dynamics in the region. This raises several important and complex questions. Could Iran still be planning an attack on Israel, or has the ceasefire reduced the likelihood of such an event? If an attack is still a possibility, how large and intense would it be? Would it involve direct military action, the use of proxy forces like Hezbollah, or other regional militias? Moreover, could Iran utilize its influence in Iraq as a staging ground for such operations, or might it prefer a different strategic approach?

Timing also remains a critical question. Would an attack align with previous predictions that Iran might act during a politically sensitive period, such as before the U.S. inauguration, or might they choose to wait for an alternative opportunity that aligns better with their goals? Recent developments, including the ceasefire and shifting global attention, make it unclear how these events have influenced Iran’s strategic calculations. What role might external factors, such as U.S. or Israeli military posturing, play in their decision-making? Finally, how does the broader geopolitical landscape shape the risk of escalation?

1bpbtou,IsraelPalestine,"Other than UNRWA, what organizations are bringing aid into northern Gaza? (American Jew) My liberal friends are interpreting Israel's announcement about blocking UNRWA aid as blocking _ALL_ aid. Western media isn't doing anything to correct that view.

Reuters [reports](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-opening-new-aid-routes-into-gaza-2024-03-22/) that the IDF will be allowing more aid in.

I understand Israel wants to get UNRWA out of the equation. UNRWA has been an essential lifeline for Palestinians. However, experts and moderate organizations have been critical of UNRWA for decades. Criticisms include ties to Hamas, perpetuating rather than solving the refugee crisis, the need and fairness of a dedicated refugee organization besides UNHCR, and more. I don't want to argue these points here. I merely want to substantiate that Israel has continued to work with UNRWA despite decades of criticism from multiple angles.

I also understand wanting to strongly disincentivize people from remaining in northern Gaza. I concede that compelling millions of Gazans to migrate southward is part of what has created the current humanitarian crisis. However, I believe that those refusing to have made the situation much worse for themselves. I don't want to argue this point here, either. To do so would be [armchair quarterbacking](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/armchair_quarterback) a war. I am not a military expert. 

Setting the above aside, it remains clear that the _people_ of Gaza are in danger of starvation and epidemics. I don't know how to compare their condition to South Sudan, Tigray, Yemen, or Syria. It's not necessary. They _MUST_ get food and medical assistance.

Even in Russia as mad and dangerous as it seems there is someone like Navalny who still has a shot. This is all far away from my point but also very close.

From what I can glean apparently Fatah is too fat and stupid and corrupt for anyone to want them to govern Gaza. It's been 18 years with no elections so a whole generation has grown up with this world view but there's 7 million Palestinians in the WB and Gaza, sure a lot are propagandised but there are also, enough intellectual or savvy youth who can rally their people with the truth and vision of their words, (as opposed to religious war hyperbola) who can grasp the situation and actually take leadership by the shear force of their rhetoric. Young people with a brain, like the Justin Pearces of the world.

I find this puzzling because whether they elected them or not, their leaders (hamas) are actual bone fide genuine medieval barbaric lunatics whose only aim obviously can only ever mean an endless reign of terror upon their own citizens. Why has not someone with a brain risen up to lead the palestinians out of this, surely now is the time to carpe diem for someone.

1k4gh77,IsraelPalestine,"It doesn't matter if Israeli jews are native or not. It seems to me that half of the debate (maybe even more) on the topic of Israel/Palestine centers around indigeneity and who has the right to the land. The P side will argue that Israelis are colonizers who stole the land from the indigenous Palestinians 80 years ago, the I side will argue that this is the Ancestral homeland of jews from 3000 years ago and therefore jews have a right to live there. And I am here to argue that this debate is pointless and a complete waste of time.

Lets assume that the anti-zionist story is correct. Lets assume that in 1948 a bunch of white polish people came to what was then Palestine, kicked all the native brown Palestinians out, and then renamed the place to Israel. My next question to the anti-zionists would be: so what?

Perhaps you could go invent a time machine and go back 100 years ago and prevent the Zionists from achieving their goals. But until you figure that out you must accept the fact that the past cannot be changed and that we exist in 2025, not 1948. 

The current situation in 2025 is that over 7 million jews live in Israel, most of them being born there, and they will not leave voluntarily. It doesnt matter how many times you draw a map of Israel but with the colors of a watermelon, the palestinian flag, or a black and white kafia. It doesnt matter how many times you call it ""israel"" (with quotes) , ""isntreal"", ""occupied palestine"", ""the zionist entity"", etc... It doesnt matter how many times you go out on the streets saying ""from the river to the sea"" or ""min maya l maya"". The jews arent going to leave because of those things.

The only choices the Palestinians have in this matter are the following.

1. accept that Israel exists and make peace with it.

2. try to force the jews to leave through violence/war.

Over a year ago the Palestinians chose option 2 (after choosing option 2 many times as well in the past ) and ill let you be the judge of whether it was a good choice or not. Ill let you decide whether a bunch of guys with water pipe rockets and assault rifles can fully conquer a country that has a military of over 100k active, 400k reserves, advanced Jets, tanks, and (allegedly) nuclear weapons.",,

I just can’t believe everyone falls for Hamas propaganda. The citizens are brainwashed and just helping Hamas continually terrorize Israel. Most all of them got warnings about the bombings coming. What other military does these incredibly considerate things. 

Follow all those reporters. They run to the bombings so if it was everywhere they wouldn’t need to run around so much. The hospitals just have people hanging out outside. All clearly a bunch of stand around shires with a few crisis actors. 

They are even aging all these reporters. Like one guy I follow looks 30 years older im since the start of the war. They got everyone in on it. Even doctors going on live news screaming about atrocities 👏

Israel never lies and they don’t shoot propaganda. Their only agenda is to get rid of Hamas then they will open all the borders to the Palestinians can be free again. Even right now, they are letting people through the border but they don’t want to brag so they don’t show that stuff. 

Really all the terror that Palestinians complain about is just misunderstandings.

Emirati Gaza Day After Plan with inputs from USA and Israel. Rejected by Palestinian Authority (PLO). 

1. Address the humanitarian crisis: Provide coordinated aid and initiate reconstruction in Gaza. No mentioned of UNRWA. Palestinian Authority through a Gaza Committee to oversee Gaza reconstruction, financed by United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and other international donors. 

2. Establish law and order: Lay the groundwork for governance. No mentioned of United Nations. Accordingly, Palestinian Authority requested an international mission deployed to replace Israeli military presence. UAE made the same proposal, clarified by adding Arab forces including contracted security staff and no involvement of Palestinian in security at the outset.

3. Prepare for reunification: Pave the way for eventual reunification of Gaza and the West Bank under the PA’s sole authority. UAE plan requires Palestinian Authority to reform, demostrate transparency, rebuild trust with Palestinian people and international community. This very much offended the Palestinian Authority leadership.

Emirati plan proposes a progression towards a two-state solution. 

Palestinian Authority doesnt want a plan for Gaza only, so to speak. Palestinian Authority wants a plan for all of Palestine and to piggyback on the Gaza issue. Palestinian Authority is pushing for a united Palestine now (Gaza, West Bank and East Jerusalem) under Palestinian Authority as the sole legitimate representative… this will be very problematic especially East Jerusalem was already annexed by Israel since 1967. 

4. There is no specific mentioned of the Philadelphi corridor or borders (such as Rafah crossing or Kerem Shalom crossing) at outset. 

5. Overall the Emirati plan ticks alot of boxes on both sides (Pro-Israel camp and Pro-Palestinian camp). International force including Arab forces to oversea security of Gaza. International donors including UAE, Saudi, etc…help rebuild Gaza. A progression towards a two state solution.

I don't think they realize how much this destroys their credibility. Anyone who has been to Israel or spent any significant amount of time in Jewish communities abroad knows that the vast majority of Jews are brunette and Mediterranean-looking — both the ones who came from Europe, as well as the ones from Africa and the Middle East. Literally, all it takes is walking down the street in Israel or walking into a synagogue anywhere on the planet to figure this out. Genetically, Ashkenazi Jews are about 50% Levantine and 30% Italian, Mediterranean places that are not full of blond, Polish-looking people. And the Mizrahi Jews — who are most of the Israeli population — have all Middle Eastern/Africa DNA.

The ""Polish"" thing in particular is very telling. Poland is not even where most Jews today are from (Russian Jews and Moroccan Jews, for instance, are a zillion times more common). Poland is just where most Jews died in the Holocaust. The moment you describe Jews as looking ""Polish"" or saying ""Go back to Poland"", you sound like you are fantasizing about the Holocaust.

The best intentions I can imagine for someone who says stuff like this is that they met exactly one Jewish family in their life, and that family happened to be the tiny fraction of Jewish families who are blond. Or people who only know about Jews from TV, where Jews are frequently played by whiter-looking actors (that's true of all races — black people on TV tend to be lighter skinned than the average black person in real life). So ignorance, rather than genocidal rage. That's as good as it gets for these people.

The thing about antisemitism is, it's not really about Jews. It's about making Jews symbols of whatever you hate. This is a really great example of that. Many Pro-Palestinians have this bad white people v. good brown people worldview, and they want to make Jews symbols of the ""bad white people."" So they stick on all the characteristics they need to make that happen. Blue eyes and blond hair have nothing to do with Jewish people, but they fit the ""bad white people"" stereotype that Pro-Palestinians have in their heads, so they tack that onto Jewish people. Calling Jews ""settler-colonizers"", ""colonizers"", ""apartheid"" etc. is exactly the same thing.

1bhfvhd,IsraelPalestine,"What is your daily life like, hows it changed? So at first, I know this sounds like a stupid question. its war it is not pleasant. you probably know people who have died in some way because of the war; I get it. but aside from fear and pain what is life like on either side. I've heard some things and I don't know about their accuracy. For one thing about starvation in Palestine, I don't think that's accurate at least in many regions. some regions may be bare and those are the ones you hear about but in other cities, I've heard Palestinians admit that the starvation news is mostly lies.

For people living in the Rafah, how is daily life? For people who have been evacuated how is the process what are the difficulties specifically of said actions? What has life been like what do you do daily? How accurate is al jazzier? what are the actual factors you would say affect you and your daily life? do you still support Hamas?

In Israel how has daily life been? how has an increase in inflation affected you? For terror attacks how have you handled dangerous times? what do you think of the pm? what is your opinion of other countries like France, Britain, and Germany? What is your opinion on America? What about the squad? what do you think about leftist/right-wing ideals?

Also, does no one even think about how Iran is responsible despite supplying and encouraging this war? Seriously the Middle East is a mess and the best way to save it is to build connections between Israel, Iraq, and Saudi as that would probably kill Iran's stronghold.",,

1g7h6v8,IsraelPalestine,"My thoughts on Baseem Youssef's discusssion with Konstantin Kisin Let me preface this by saying, I cannot stand Konstantin Kisin, I smother him in the same class of reactionary pseudointellectual weirdos as Tim Pool or Dave Rubin.

That being said, he absolutely outted Basseem's emotionally ridden and childish understanding of the Israel/Palestine conflict. Baseem usually ran away from pretty softball questions and when pressed on it, the best that he could provide was ""I don't know"" or try to make pretty malleable equivalcies, he tried the pompous sarcastic demeanor here too and tripped over himself.

Baseem's arguements were all packaged with ""Civilians dying is bad"" which is pretty agreeable right? But when Konstantin presents him with examples in the past like the bombing of Dresden and how it was neccesary to defeat the evil of Nazi Govt. of Germany. Baseem flatly says its wrong but fails to provide another alternative solution....He continues on by doing the same hyperbolic strawman of ""the world doesn't see Arabs as humans so there death count means nothing"" so he doesn't have to get into the nitty and gritty ""proportionality"" arguements.

Nonetheless, I thought he was a change of pace from the usual voice in mainstream media regarding the conflict but his world view and understanding is very infantile and he is unable to provide any ideas beyond complaints.

Has the Israeli regime always been dishonest about its real war aims? Are we now witnessing the final phase of a meticulously planned ethnic cleansing of Gaza, or is this Plan B, C, or D? Were this against international law, would it even make a difference, given that the very idea of international law is often held in high contempt by Israel?

My argument is based on:

* The forced displacement implemented almost immediately after 7 October 2023.
* The 17-year-long siege and collective punishment.
* The indiscriminate and ethnicity-based nature of this conflict.
* The intent to remove all civilians from an ethnically homogenous area.

What we are witnessing is, in my view, stone-cold, textbook ethnic cleansing. ""rendering an area ethnically homogeneous by using force or intimidation to remove persons of given groups from the area"" (UN Security Council, 1994).

What are the implications of this for Israel’s security? I contend that this represents extremely short-sighted, bloody-mindedness in pursuit of security.

My argument is that:

* Normalising this moral degradation undermines values held by Israeli citizens, leading to widespread intolerance and aggression within Israel’s borders, and unrest will follow.
* The divides in national unity will deepen, making “flight or fight” the norm.
* Israel’s standing in the world, already weak, will deteriorate further, and this isolation will diminish the country’s prosperity.
* Future generations of Israelis, who have played no part in these actions, will struggle with cognitive dissonance from birth, bearing the “original sin” of their forefathers.
* This will not lead to long-lasting peace.
* The collective guilt and shame of committing such a crime—if indeed proven as such under international law—will have a lasting, damaging impact. Not least, there may come the painful realisation that there are no eternal victims.",,

1kpx5oz,IsraelPalestine,"Is it justified to condemn Biden after his support of Israel? To start, I hope I did/do not break any rules with this post. First time poster, and this is truly meant as an honest inquiry.

As many of you probably know, former president Biden was diagnosed with an ""aggressive form"" of prostate cancer today. I am American, and, although I was not old enough to vote for him when he ran in 2020, I do recognize that he had a strong relationship with Israel. One of his last acts as president was organizing the cease fire. As he was diagnosed today, I was going through a few subreddits and other forums, and I saw a good majority of commenters stating things such as, ""People are mourning this? He funded a genocide yall jfc"" and ""Girl fuck his zionist ass"". I was pretty disheartened, to be frank. I am not denying that what is going on in Gaza is horrific, and Biden did fund Israel military operations and offer support, but to narrow down such drastic decisions his administration made to being Zionist? From what I understand, the majority of his support came after October 7th, which doesn't mean that the deaths of the Palestinians is justified, but it was following one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Israel. I am not fully educated in his policies, but I would figure that the decision to support Israel comes from being longstanding allies, along with complex political relationships (along with the fact that nothing is as black or white as some would like to believe). I would love to hear opinions regarding this, as I'm unable to have honest conversations within my current environment regarding Israel and Palestine. Thank you.

Edit: I just want to clarify that I am not happy that Joe Biden has cancer. I meant this as an honest question, and it was never my intention to portray that I'm content with him learning that he has an aggressive form of cancer.",,

1bo9gao,IsraelPalestine,"I genuinely do not understand why many Palestinians still favour violent resistance. Do they really think they can win in a military struggle against Israel? They had a chance for two states in 1937 through the peel commission which offered them 80% of the land but they didn’t take it and chose violent riots instead. They had another chance for peaceful coexistence after the 1947 UN resolution which divided the land roughly evenly (giving a substantial part of the swamps and desert land to the Jews) and allowed Palestinians equal rights in the Israeli Declaration of Independence, they did not take it and chose violence instead. As a result they lost roughly 15-20% of the original land the UN provided them with and were subjected to decades of occupation from Jordan and Egypt. In 1967 they chose violence again when the 3 no’s were issued in Khartoum even after Israel was discussing an independent Palestinian state. After the Oslo accords failed to achieve the desired results, the first intifada began. Then once again after the failed negotiations at Camp David in 2000 instead of negotiating Arafat refused to compromise. This led to the 2nd intifada. As a result of this “resistance” Israel was forced to imposed security measures which are still in place in the West Bank to protect their citizens. These are the measures many human rights groups consider to be “apartheid” conditions. After Israel gave Palestinians autonomy in 2005, rather than choosing peaceful coexistence, they elected Hamas which led to a blockade imposed by Egypt and Israel. After decades of rockets, on October 7th once again they chose violent resistance. This has led to the complete destruction of most of Gaza and a humanitarian crisis. Still 80% of Palestinians support what happened on October 7th (perhaps they are ignorant about the civilians killed). Now all Palestinian work permits have been revoked due to IDF intelligence that some collaborated with the terrorists on October 7th. This will likely lead to significant economic hardship for Palestinians. More than half the population in the West Bank support Hamas. Every time Palestinians have chosen the path of violent resistance it has made their lives so much worse. 

I understand the desire for political autonomy but I honestly can’t understand why this is still their strategy. Is it due to religious delusions that Allah is on their side? A desire to martyr themselves and their people for their cause? A delusion that the Arab world will win against Israel and the US?",,

🇮🇱🔥🇵🇸
- All of us who are connected to the daily life of the war remember Mia Schem, 21 years old, an Israeli of French origin, kidnapped on October 7 from the SuperNova Music Festival, who shortly after the kidnapping appeared in a video published by Hamas with a bandaged arm and begging #Israel to do everything possible to free her.
- Mia has become very popular in Israel and unlike other freed hostages, she has given several interviews to the media and exposes her trauma a lot on her social networks, so her story is already well known in Israeli society.
- Among many of her experiences, she tells how she was wounded by a bullet in the arm and was transported for hours from one place to another until she was finally housed in the family home of one of the kidnappers.
- Mia claims that there she was ""treated"" by a veterinarian who operated on her wound without any anesthesia while they tied her up, and that to silence her screams they threatened to drag her to the tunnels if she did not stop complaining, until she was overcome by the shock of pain. ""Stop it. Or I'll send you to the tunnels!""
- I couldn't shower for 54 days despite having an open wound after surgery on my arm, nor clean the wound or change the bandages.
- They kept her in a dark room in this family home, and she describes that she lived with the kidnapper's children and wife, who hated her and mocked her because her husband couldn't stop looking at her with lust. At one point Mia says, ""All of Gaza are terrorists. They're Hamas.""
- Last week, after the intense Israeli bombings, Hamas moved her to some tunnels where she lived with other hostages (of whom she cannot reveal details).
- She says that they were kept in a dark cage and that they barely gave them anything to eat, just one piece of pita bread a day, and that during those days she reached her breaking point and gave up just before being released.
- He said that the conditions in those tunnels are beyond imagination and that many of the hostages have been held in those conditions for more than 80 days.
- During the last interview she burst into tears for having left the other hostages behind after her release (the tremendous typical survivor's guilt) . - Although several weeks have passed since she returned home, in each interview it is clear that Mia He is still in shock and with his emotions stunted, he avoids mentioning the sexual abuse suffered by the hostages in the tunnels, and he is still in survivor mode.

&gt;""$23.3 billion would be paid in total to the families of those elite officials who wield power in Pyongyang, while he noted that the top ten families would receive $30 million each, and the top thousand families would get $5 million. Another sum of $121.8 billion would go to the country’s general population to start their life again post-reunification. it's envisioned that the proceeds for the fund is to be raised from private groups and business moguls.""

Which of course, brings us to the current situation in Gaza. Between the 1949 Armistice Agreements and the 1967 Six-Day War, Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip and no Palestinian Arab state existed, which I mention only to convey the reality that Gaza being part of Egypt has historical precedent.

So can Israel just BRIBE Egypt to return Gaza to Egyptian control? I understand why Egypt wouldn't want to, of course, but surely there's *some* number that would make it worth their while?

And to the Israel supporters who might complain about cost- consider the cost of October 7th. Consider the cost of the war. Yes, my proposal isn't exactly cheap, but if such a proposal puts an end to the murder of innocent Israelis by Hamas, is that not priceless?

1kcwvls,IsraelPalestine,"A Showdown on Iran A couple of weeks--or so--ago I wrote this post about war with Iran.  I also got a 7 day ban for that post for a statement I made--said to be a violation of Rule 6.  I pointed out that American soldiers machine gunned these guards at this prison camp and I included mention of the affiliation of the guard.  I got an email message saying I was banned for 7 days.  The ban was also lifted on that same day.  But I did not know I was unbanned and so I did not respond to comments.

Things have changed since I typed at post.  At that time I said that there was no way that the United States would go to war with Iran.

At that time Bibi was not applying heavy pressure.  

Before Witkoff's first meeting with the Iranians he said this:

“Where our red line will be—there can’t be weaponization of your nuclear capability.”  Witkoff

Bibi had demanded the Libyan model before Bibi flew home from his last meeting with Trump.  

Bibi continues to demand the Libyan model, which goes far beyond what Witkoff said about the red line and it falls far short of the demands of Trump's letter to Iran.

Regarding Trump's letter--Trump says he always starts negotiations with extreme demands--he says that in The Art of the Deal and in most of his other books.  I do not know the exact details 

The Libyan model would include ballistic missiles which Trump did not include in his letter, which I just looked at.  He demanded an end to work on nuclear weapons and an end to enrichment activities.

As of earlier this week in his speech at the JNS conference Bibi was still demanding the Libyan model--that is, demands that include and end to ballistic missiles and--I believe Bibi's demands regarding the nuclear program go beyond Trump's but i am not sure how Bibi's demands go beyond Trump's.

Now I think I was naïve about things when I typed that post.  I was aware that Bibi has won every single showdown U.S. presidents.  We all know that.

I still believe that no United States troops will go into Iran.

But troops don't have to enter a country to make war against that country.  The United States is at war with Yemen right now.  The war in Yemen is for Israel's benefit, not for the benefit of the United States.

What about Trump and America First?

Considering that Trump has exchanged his ""America First"" plan to an ""Israel First"" plan and that Netanyahu has never lost a showdown with a U.S. president, I have to retract my assertion that the United States will not go to war with Iran.

At this moment if I could place a bet, even a sizable bet, that the United States is going to war with Iran, I would definitely place that bet.  That is not to say I agree with it, but it sure looks to me like it will happen.

I have heard Israeli commentators on JNS say that the United States really does not need Israel's help and that Israel will stay out of it, or could stay out of it.

If we knew it were true that troops would enter Iran, Trump is going to try to demand that the IDF lead the way into Iran.

In his past showdowns with American presidents Bibi has been able to bring both parties in both houses of Congress down on the U.S. president.  I don't have any reason to believe that he can't do that now.

I believe that Trump has prepared for this showdown, but now I do not see how Trump can win it.

There is still a problem for Israel.  Special interest lobbies work best in the dark.  The Israeli lobby is not the only lobby that controls Congress.  Defense contractor lobbies also own Congress, and so does the AMA.

But the light shines only on the Israeli.  People laughed when Pat Buchanan claimed that Capitol Hill was Israeli occupied territory.  Nobody laughs at that claim now.

Right now the lobby still rules.

And Bibi is going to show Trump that Bibi is still the Man.",,

This isn't coming from a place of malice, like I don't wanna start some big argument, I'm just genuinely curious, like, why are ye all pro-israel?

And, no, I am not someone who got all their information from Instagram posts, I have genuinely gone out and read about the history of the conflict, and the history of the middle east in general. I've always meant to read up on that part of the world and the more I read the more I became pro-palestine.

I found it interesting, but also very eye-opening. I try to look at both perspectives, and that's why I'm asking for your opinions because I know this sub-reddit is very pro-israel. And maybe the books I read were biased, which everything in history is, I guess, so I'd like another perspective so I can create a reliable case for myself.

It's also just confusing me a little bit.

From an Israeli standpoint, the war on Gaza is a war on Hamas, is it not? And so the goal is to get rid of Hamas? That's the part that confuses me, because surely everyone knows you cannot 'exterminate' a terrorist group. Where one person is killed another person turns more extreme. You can kill the leaders, but another one will always fill the gap. The more you kill the more you destroy the more extremists you create. The US would know all about that, but I don't think they care because they're funding the whole operation.

Anyways, I'm genuinely asking for your opinions, except I'd rather not listen to a long spiel about jihadist extremism because I've read enough about that over the past few months, actually, tell me whatever the fuck you want .

# The Start

On August 1990 a Iraqi Mig-25 reconnaissance fighter jet flies over khafji while the entire world prepares for the upcoming war, Meanwhile in the US the pentagon has prepared to set Iraq as the biggest threat after the fall of the Soviet Union and plans were made before as early as the 50s for the invasion of Iraq.

[A Iraqi Mig-25 in the background](https://preview.redd.it/n4dmiw978qge1.png?width=262&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0773c212975e6917a97fedb664274d1b1cde1dd)

On December 1990 high ranking Iraqi officers Gathered at Basra to prepare for the inevitable contact on the battlefield, the Americans did not accept any truces, ceases, or agreements, this was the opportunity to destroy Iraq.

[The President Cooking for high ranking officers in Basra, December\/1990](https://preview.redd.it/hffnz5jhaqge1.png?width=915&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d812dfd721a4b398890a3c56016ab91b36448adc)

In Basra many things were said many things were noted, the officers were told that their experience in Iran was not adequate and that the Iranian is far more brave than the American, alongside higher numbers and technological advancements which the Iranian lacked, they knew beforehand most of the issues they would encounter and prepared for it, one officer advised his comrade in this gathering to always create smoke via tire fire or bombing oil wells because not only will this create a screen but also will mess with the enemy thermals, at night use the explosion for illumination, and to master the art of camouflage to stay hidden in the open, and here the plan for Khafji among many other plans began to be made.

[Iraqi Republican Guard training with tire smoke](https://preview.redd.it/tty5pebicqge1.png?width=458&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6d00ef52b0a6b63be7c2b086ee9c680a145a24db)

Immediately the plans were being executed in Iraqi Kuwait, trench's were made, bunkers constructed for artillery and the surface-to-surface missile-rocket battalion entered Iraqi Kuwait, here the Khafji artillery battalion was formed.

While all this was happening Iraq and many other Arab Nations were trying to solve the issues diplomatically without military confrontation, but the Anglo-sphere had different plans and attempted everything it can to lead the path of war.

On January 17 because the talks were not satisfactory Iraq did not leave and the US finally got its excuse to bomb Iraq, at first Iraqi Kuwait was being bombed, the bombings included civilian infrastructure like roads and oil wells which surprised the Iraqi's, but then gradually passing the hour a continuous bombing inside Iraq would take place of which it too targeted civilians.

Around 50 scuds both Iraqi made and Soviet made successfully hit Israel, and throughout that entire war they only managed to down 3, unfortunately the enemy they were facing is not a human but a machine that does not care or value human life, instead of reaching for peace they attempted to target the Iraqi scuds and failed miserably, which meant that the bombings on Iraqi and Kuwaiti civilians did not stop and other measures had to be made quickly, on January 18-19 high ranking Iraqi officers gathered at Kuwait but it was deemed unsafe and they were right as they left their gathering area it got bombed by a F-111, they then went to Basra, the city of Basra was being bombed itself and one Iraqi officer commented ""Are these for liberation of Kuwait or for the destruction of Iraq ?"", when arrived at Basra they were surprised to meet the President himself who wanted to help them in their planning.

In that gathering they all agreed to go ahead with the Khafji plan, why Khafji ? because it has a water treatment plant for that region of Saudi Arabia alongside a airfield and a small port which was being used by the coalition, it also has oil wells, oil tanks, and refineries, the idea is to thwart and confuse the enemy as well as directing air/land attacks from Kuwait and Iraq.

While the preparations were being made and in retaliation of the bombings the officers decided to shell Khafji (which was half abandoned by its citizens) by the Khafji battery alongside launching Luna-m surface-to-surface missile/rocket on Khafji, they targeted oil wells mostly.

The attacks which were in retaliation mostly targeted oil wells, this still prompted the civilians to evacuate and abandon Khafji all together, some Americans described it as a ghost town.

1ia7n7v,IsraelPalestine,"When a broken clock is right: Wouldn't you say that Trump understands the Middle-East more? Biden flew to Israel and became the first American president to visit it during wartime.

These tributes came from the heart. Biden is a true Zionist, a Democratic Hawk at his core, but sadly his party is different (He can't be blamed for it). The question was not whether Biden would share in Israel's sorrow. The question was whether Biden would stand up for Israel's defense even when there is a price to pay when the best defense is offense? 

How will the administration react when the IDF enters Gaza? When the pro-Palestinian propaganda machine justify Hamas? When would Progressives do moral equivalence? When American campuses fill with protests in support of Hamas and anti-Semitic harassment of Jewish students? As anti-Israel voices within the Democratic Party grow louder and will urge the admin to tie Israel's hands, and anti-Israel wolves in the UN and the International Court of Justice will begin to whine?

The answer is that when these things happened, the admin hesitated. True, Biden himself spoke about Israel's right to self-defense. And people in the admin like Harris condemned anti-Semitism - while constantly equating this widespread and deadly hatred with isolated cases of Islamophobia. But as the war dragged on, the administration's rhetoric and policies became worse. 

They refunded UNRWA and other Palestinian causes, turned their back on the Abraham Accords, and returned to a failed policy of indulging the Palestinians, satisfying their demands, and protecting them from losing the war. So there is no wonder that the Biden/Harris administration ends its term when the entire region is in chaos.  
  
Their policy was ""De-escalation,"" calming the spirits and appeasement. Throughout the year, he continued to call on all sides to lay down their arms and reduce tensions. But his words were empty. Without a credible threat of force on Iran and Hamas, the only country Biden could pressure was Israel. His attempts to change Israel's war plan widened the confrontation and prolonged the bloodshed.

Look at Rafah. It was known to be Hamas' last stronghold. Yet, in February, when the Democratic Party was concerned about the Arab vote in the elections, Biden warned Israel not to enter Rafah without a ""evacuation plan"" for the civilian population. In March, Kamala Harris said she would not rule out drawing conclusions about Israel if it entered Rafah because ""I've studied the maps"" and ""these people have nowhere to go."" Meanwhile, Biden delayed the transfer of weapons to Israel to prevent it from acting or at least to delay its actions. The push for a Palestinian state and a Two-State solution only gave Hamas more motivation, along with the aid policy through UNRWA that kept italive

In May, the IDF finally entered Rafah. Earlier, in mid-April, Iran directly attacked Israel for the first time in history - and not the last. Biden's response hinted that the US and its allies would help Israel defend itself - as long as Israel did not respond to Iran ""disproportionately."" For example, Biden called on Israel to ""seize victory"" after the attack smoke cleared. If what happened in April seemed like a ""victory"" to Biden, he should seek a reality check. Victory is not escaping the worst outcome. Victory is achieving the best outcome.

As the months passed and as contradictions in Biden's policy intensified, Israel took the initiative and ignored the admin. It eradicated Hamas leadership. It eliminated Hezbollah's command chain in spite of the policies of the administration. It launched a ground attack in Lebanon to remove Hezbollah. It assassinated the mastermind of the October 7 attack, Yahya Sanwar - where else but in Rafah.

Trump's policies, with all the criticism of him and the fact that he is a fascist, have been proven right in the Middle East (probably the only time I will agree with his policies since I am a liberal). His policy in the Middle East brought maximum pressure on Iran, the Abraham Accords, and the proof that it is possible to make a real and warm peace in the region without constantly dealing with the Palestinian plotter that only hinders development in the region and causes terrorism and loss of life. Is the right-wing policy of the Israeli government right? Absolutely not. But the administration's policy did the same damage only from the other side",,

Wouldn’t the Hashemite King Abullah II of Jordan be an illegitimate occupier of Palestinian land? 

Why are there no protests around the world to remove King Abdullah from occupying Palestinian land?

Why aren’t Pro-Palestinian protesters burning the Jordanian flag?

Why don’t Pro-Palestinians wage an intifada against Jordan? Or is blowing up a bus full of civilians only ok when most of the civilians are Jewish?

Why is the chant “from the river to sea, Palestine will be free?” Instead of “from the sea to the Syrian desert, Palestine will be free”? Is it because the second chant doesn’t roll off the tongue as nicely? Or is it because of some other reason?",,

180fhm8,IsraelPalestine,"Hasbara? So been reading quite a bit about the history of Israel and the creation of it. Seems like the talking points and trends have shifted a lot from the early days.

I understand why, and I understand the lobbying power Israel and the Jewish people have accumulated. But it seems like the masks are coming off and the reactions we are seeing on the ground and online are begining to seem more and more desperate. I'm sorry for the Palestinians because their the ones shouldering these desperate aggressive reactions.

But the more activity I see online of Hasbara interacting with each other is making me laugh. I know there a lot of none-Hasbara on here as well. But do you guys realize you've created your own echo-chamber and are talking to each other now? Like the point is to move people to your side, slowly gain trust, and guide people to be more and more pro-Israel. But it seems like the gentle approach isn't working anymore so you're trying a more aggressive one? 

I dont know.. find it interesting.. thought this place (reddit / this sub-reddit) would be a nice place to try to take in the opposite point of view. But i can see it's just a place where Hasbara has infiltrated because other places on social media have been too dificult to control. And it feels like the messaging that has been pushed has driven many actual people away, people who were trying to understand the history and make sense of the present.

Downvote me all you want. For anyone reading this, if you're knowingly pushing propaganda.. i'm sorry for you.. if you're doing it unknowingly.. i'm even more sorry for you. If you're here to get some information.. I'd go someplace else, try not asking people, especially online. Look at the history starting in the 1880s, ask your questions and you'll can figure out who has the moral high ground in this ""conflict""",,
18z9bd7,AskMiddleEast,"Why are westerners still saying that Israel is better then palestine, how and why and where is this coming from",,
1h8yb8a,AskMiddleEast,"Many people are not aware of the true horror of what the Assad regime has done in Syria People have heard about the crimes of the Assad regime, from the indiscriminate carpet and barrel bombings, to the countless rapes and massacres. However, amongst all of these, his regime has carried out something far worse, something so horrifying that it ranks amongst the worst crimes in human history. What I’m referring to is the fate of the so called ‘forcibly disappeared persons’.

At the lower end, human rights groups estimate that at least 100,000 Syrians have gone missing after being abducted by the regime’s intelligent services/Mukhabarat since the start of the civil war, including thousands of women, children and infants. But the true figure is likely far higher - no one really knows for sure. Their alleged crimes include attending anti-government protests, writing messages against the regime, smuggling food and baby products into towns/cities under siege, living in an opposition-held area, being a relative of someone they are after or just being in the wrong place at the wrong time. And what then happens to these missing persons is difficult to convey in writing.

The abducted Syrians are passed through the regime’s network of secret prisons, which are effectively concentration camps and torture dungeons. They are then sadistically tortured without mercy, with tens of thousands having been literally tortured to death. The methods of torture include:

\- Beatings with batons, bars and plastic pipes

\- Burning the body with boiling water, cigarettes, acid, melted plastic or being burnt alive

\- Rape using foreign and sharp objects, often leading to fatal injuries

\- Deliberate starvation and lack of water

\- Having fingernails, fingers, toes, ears cut off

\- Having eyes gouged out (you will see this in a lot of the Caesar photos)

\- Holes drilled through various parts of the body

\- Bones broken

\- Electrocutions

\- Mutilations of genitals

\- Being put on racks and bent/stretched until their bones and joints snap

\- Being put in a tyre and having their feet beaten

\- Having family members, including their wives, parents, sisters and children, being tortured and raped in front of them.

The torture is not meant to extract confessions, according to the regime, anyone against their dictatorship is a terrorist (like the Israelis they have weaponised this word to gain sympathy from the West). It’s more a form of sadistic punishment, torture for the sake of torture, and for the amusement for the guards and officials. However, perhaps most importantly, it is designed to keep the Syrian population in fear of ever speaking out against their totalitarian state. This mass torture, which goes back to the years of Hafez Assad under places like Tadmor Prison, is an open secret in Syria. They were also used as part of America’s so called rendition programme, where suspects abroad like Maher Arar were tortured in Syria. The regime also uses prisoners as ransom and a form of income, bribing families for tens of thousands of dollars in exchange for the release of their loved ones. However, in most cases they take the money without releasing the prisoners.

Of course the regime bans all reporters and human rights groups from these prisons but the evidence for this taking place is overwhelming - you have testimonies of tens of thousands of Syrians, accounts of defectors, human rights investigations, smuggled photos, videos and court cases resulting in prosecution in European countries.  I have provided some links at the end of the post if you would like further information/reading – warning, many of these are NSFL. However, people need to be aware how evil this regime has been, especially as many Muslims defend the regime. They defend the regime despite it burning and [burying alive](https://x.com/doamuslims/status/1743715687665734096) Muslims for refusing to say that “there is no God but Bashar”. They defend the regime, even when it massacred thousands of Syrians of Palestinians of descent in places like [Tadamon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bD5YfRairtQ&amp;ab_channel=%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF) and Yarmouk. They defend the regime when it bans Islam from it’s prisons and their guards insult God and the prophets in the most vile manner. They defend the regime despite it starting the war by shooting protestors and torturing children, and they still defend it when it is responsible for between [90-95%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/697138/civilian-deaths-in-syria-by-party-responsible/) (depending on the body collecting the data) of all the deaths in the war. It’s also not just Syrians who have been tortured to death, you have also had cases like [Abbas Khan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/27/british-doctor-abbas-khan-unlawfully-killed-syria-jury-inquest), the British-Pakistani doctor, who was was killed and had seen children being tortured and crying for their parents. You also have the likes of Kevin Dawes, who stated that he had seen children tortured to death in front of him, and many others such as Madj Kamalmaz who have never returned. No other party in the war, not even ISIS, has come anywhere close to the scale and level of evil that the regime has been responsible for throughout this war.

  
I am writing this post as many Syrians are being released from prisons being captured by the rebels (who have repeatedly said that freeing detainees has been one of their main motivations for their offensive), some of them having been imprisoned for over 40 years, with their family having no idea where they are or if they're alive or not. You can also listen to their accounts of torture, unfortunately many who have gone through the experience are permanently mentally scarred (some who were released in previous years went insane or lost their memory entirely due to the torture) and physically they are not the same. InshAllah we will very soon the liberation of places like Adra Prison, Palestinian Branch and perhaps most infamously, the worst place on earth, Sednaya Prison. Once liberated, these places will become a testament to the horror that has taken place in Syria for the last 50 years, much like Unit 731 and Tuol Sleng.

If we agree that Hamas' indiscriminate killing of innocent Israelis was horrific, why isn't the general public perception that Hamas needs to free the hostages and unconditionally surrender?  Why aren't there large protests around the world demanding this?

Is it because people know Hamas will never give up their weapons and just accept that?  And so they think that the only way to end the war is for Israel to unilaterally put down their weapons?  Or is there something else I'm missing?

This video is very heavily skewed in favour of Palestinians and is missing a lot of information. Claiming the land was completely stolen by Israelis or zionists is blatantly false. The majority of land in that period was publicly owned. A lot of it was purchased legally from Arabs for European Jews. Yes Arabs were evicted but they had no legal claim to the land. The original UN plan would have resulted in Israel having only a 55% Jewish population yet it was still accepted. There’s also no mention of the peel commission which offered only 20% of the land to Israelis. Once again this was accepted by the Israelis and rejected by Arabs.

No mention of the fact that the West Bank and Gaza were occupied by Jordan and Egypt from 1949-1967 without any attempts to create an independent Palestinian state in these areas or the fact that Jordan expelled and killed thousands of Palestinians from its territory during black September. These Palestinians created the PLO which hijacked plans, tortured and killed Israeli athletes, and contributed to the Lebanese civil war. They also tried to assasinate the king of Jordan and revolt. Israel did not conquer “a lot” of territory their borders on expanded slightly after the war of independence, another inaccurate statement. It’s ridiculous to claim that establishing settlements in an area you control is an apartheid. No mention of terror groups in the West Bank either. Neither side respected the terms of the Oslo accords. The video also barely mentions the fact the there are only 330,000 settlements and around 2 million Palestinians or the reason for the construction of the wall (1st and 2nd intifada). Israel is probably one of the only countries that has been expected to return all of the territory conquered in an offensive war.

So I was watching this YouTube video [Palestinians: When was Palestine established?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHROSSEMzmY&amp;ab_channel=CoreyGil-Shuster) and the answers the Palestinians were giving were quite diverse. Given that it was such a simple question to ask, why are there so many different answers?

""Palestine"" isn't an Arab name, why would the local Arabs support the establishment of a country whose name [came from the word ""invader"" in Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_name_Palestine)?

Apparently, they didn't. At first at least.

In 1937, the British conducted the [Peel Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peel_Commission) in reaction to the rise of the Jewish-Arab violence in the British Mandate area. The committee suggested one of the first partition plans in which the vast majority of today's Israel will be an Arab state, and a small portion of today's Northern Israel would be a Jewish state.

During the commission, they had members of the Arab Higher Committee give testimonies. One of the testimonies that I would like you to pay attention to was that of  **Awni Abd al-Hadi** who was the general secretary. He stated that: “*There is no such country as Palestine. ‘Palestine’ is a term the Zionists invented. There is no Palestine in the Bible. Our country was for centuries part of Syria. ‘Palestine’ is alien to us. It is the Zionists who introduced it.”* 

As you can see this was an attempt by Abd al-Hadi to convince the Peel Commission to include the Mandate Palestine territories in what was called ""The greater Syria"". This goes in line with the resolutions of [the first Palestine Arab Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Arab_Congress) in Jerusalem in 1919 that stated:  *""We consider Palestine nothing but part of Arab Syria and it has never been separated from it at any stage. We are tied to it by national, religious, linguistic, moral, economic, and geographic bounds.""* 

**How did the idea of an ""Arab state of \[only\] Palestine"" suddenly appear and how did it get embedded so deep into the Palestinian mind, that they can't even remember that they themselves thought it was made up less than 100 years ago?**",,

18qqfvr,IsraelPalestine,"Unveiling the Shocking ""Secret Blueprint"" in the Middle East Conflict In order to control the intensity of the Israeli war, the United States needs to take unconventional measures. Recognizing that the main driving force behind Israel's inability to control the war's intensity is the surging populist sentiment, the Biden administration must intimidate the Israeli people.

I suggest the Biden administration unexpectedly ""leak"" two classified plans formulated by the United States and Israel, expressing deep concern similar to the reaction when Snowden leaked classified information. These plans are called ""Operation Wildfire"" and ""Operation Moses.""

Here is the main content of the leaked Operation Wildfire plan: Israel will completely eliminate Hamas and other Palestinian resistance groups, while also dealing heavy damage to Hezbollah and Syria, forcing them to recover for three to five years. However, Israel will pay a heavy price. An estimated 150,000 to 200,000 people in Israel will die, and 350,000 to 500,000 people will be disabled. The total casualties will reach 1.2 to 1.5 million people. In simpler terms, it means sacrificing two generations of young men and women. After the war, Israel will be forced to maintain a standing army of 300,000 to 350,000 in Gaza, the West Bank, and the north indefinitely. The entire war will cause Israel's GDP to decline by one-third to half. Moreover, due to the inability to contain Iran, it is predicted that Iran will possess nuclear weapons after the war ends.

The second plan is Operation Moses, a more pessimistic plan. It assumes that during the implementation of Operation Wildfire, the resistance demonstrates unexpectedly strong attack capabilities, leading to a military catastrophe for Israel with the threat of national extinction. Operation Moses involves the emergency evacuation of Jews by the United States, with the integration of European forces. The plan aims to evacuate 3.5 to 4 million Jews, granting them U.S. citizenship. With a population of over 9 million in Israel, what will happen to the remaining people? It is estimated that the Druze and Arab populations within Israel, around 3 million, will not be evacuated. This leaves 2.5 to 3 million people who will be unable to evacuate due to various reasons. Many people will die or be seriously injured during the evacuation process, and some Israelis will pledge to defend their country and refuse to evacuate. Additionally, there will be a shortage of transportation capacity, resulting in delays in evacuation.

After the major leak of these two plans, the Israeli population may be profoundly shocked and realize that the balance of power is not as they had imagined. This could shift their mentality from aggression to defense, at least calming down the surging public sentiment to some extent. This will be beneficial for Netanyahu to stabilize the Israeli military and for the United States to control the intensity of the war.",,
1kovk2q,IsraelPalestine,"questions for pro palestinians Well, I have been going back and forth on whether I should write this post, but I’ve had enough.  
To start, I live in a pro-Palestinian country, and my views would probably be different if I lived in a more pro-Israel country—but I do not. So here we are.

First, I want to bring up the double standards within the movement. Because after October 7, I saw a lot of genocidal rhetoric from pro-Palestinians—on a level I never imagined seeing in my country. And the rest of the pro-Palestinian movement seemed to just accept it, even the ones who say they are anti-genocide.

Why is that? Why don’t you speak out against all genocidal rhetoric?

And for another example of double standards:  
I have seen many pro-Palestinians share videos of IDF soldiers cheering as Gaza is bombed, saying how evil they are. Yet, when Israel gets bombed, they themselves cheer. Doesn’t that make you just as bad as the side you claim is evil?

Another thing—I have seen mobs of pro-Palestinians go after Israeli children (teens, but since teens are considered children in Gaza, I think it’s fair to call them that).  
Thank God the police created a barricade.

But how do you justify that kind of behavior from the movement you are a part of?

And why is it that every time you are faced with a hard question, you default to personal attacks?  
I have tried to get answers from people in the movement since the conflict started, and only a rare few have actually responded. But when they have, it’s been in defense of Hamas—everything from justifying hostage-taking by saying it’s not a war crime, to outright supporting the bombing of Israel.

Critiquing Israel for war crimes while defending the war crimes of Hamas—you can see why it’s hard to support a movement like that, right?

And the one question I have never gotten an answer to:  
What is the long-term solution among the pro-Palestinian movement?

Even those interviewed on television to speak for the movement can’t seem to answer that question.



And then there are the shame tactics of your movement. I have seen pro-Palestinians call people heartless monsters for not being part of the movement—why is that?  
Say I am part of the Free Tibet movement, which almost nobody cares about; you don’t see me going around guilting people for not caring about it.

So, are you then a heartless monster for not caring about the same cause as me?

And then there’s the way you go after people—not for being pro-Israel, but simply for not getting involved in the conflict.

*I know private individuals and business owners who are afraid to even ask questions to the pro-Palestinian movement, as they are mainly met with hate-* 

Let me know if you need any further refinements!

Then there is the suicide validation. When I saw how the movement validated the suicide of the American veteran last year, I lost hope in humanity—because your movement glorified a suicide.

I mean, how can you stand by a movement like that?

And then there is the movement shutting people out. I followed many pro-Palestinians until I had to stop—well, they literally said that if I am not pro-Palestinian, they don’t want to have anything to do with me.  
Not for being pro-Israel, but simply for not being pro-Palestinian.

And I will mention—not all Western media is pro-Israel. In my country, there have been articles about what a good father and husband a Hamas fighter was, without mentioning that he was a member of Hamas (both the IDF and Hamas confirmed he was a member).

I think this is most of what I want the thoughts of pro-Palestinians on.  
And I’m not interested in hearing how the Israeli side is bad—I know about that already. I just don’t see anyone taking accountability for the bad actions on the pro-Palestinian side.

So please—I would love to hear your thoughts on this, because I’m going to attempt to be more in the middle again.  
I feel like I’ve been pushed toward the Israeli side—just because every Israeli I’ve asked questions to has answered them, but pro-Palestinians don’t.

And sorry for the mess—I’m going to try using AI to spell-check this before posting, and I hope that’s okay, as English is not my first language.



\*""And I am writing this because I am a little mad—I got permanently banned from the Palestine subreddit for bringing up that my country didn’t allow Jews in before Zionism became a movement.

So this is my last attempt at trying to get answers from the movement, as I think I will leave this conflict after this—since I have the privilege of being able to do so.

again sorry if the message is a bit chaotic, its my first reddit post after all. 

Because honestly, part of me regrets reading up on this conflict to begin with.""\*",,

I heard many times the word ""pressure"", if Hamas will be allowed to survive after this war it'll mean that the whole west has been brought to its knees by a group of terrorists. A group of 20k-25k terrorists called Hamas, that is actively using a 2 mil population as a hostage and a tool for propaganda has brought a whole democracy to its knees.

will a group of evils, that openly say they want Israel to be destroy and to do 7th again and again be allowed to win?

Hamas are ones to announce the number of dead in Gaza, they claim 20k dead. How many of them are terrorists, why is the media not doubting Hamas even one bit? (I'm sure there have been uninvolved casualties which is horrific).

If Hamas survives it means:

1. Israel will probably be destroyed within a decade
2. Democracy will be a complete failure

1ae71fr,IsraelPalestine,"Why do Zionists refuse to reckon with the settlers? Over 500,000 people living in legally recognized ILLEGAL settlements, frequently terrorizing (yes, they are terrorists) Palestinians, muscling them out of their homes and villages at threat of death, shooting random people at times, and posing as official Israeli military personnel. About 70,000 of them are Americans. The Israeli government via Smotrich, Ben Gvir and the like actively fund, arm, protect, and speak their agenda into law. They are so bad that even Zionists who are otherwise insistent on Israel's sainthood won't defend them. But to denounce them is not enough. 

The settlers are Israel's dark shadow. They disprove every claim Israel makes about what kind of country it is. They do not want peace, they are extremely racist and Jewish supremacist, they laugh in the face of international law, they attack the innocent (no self defense), etc etc. Now, every country has untamed militants. You can't for example hold all of America responsible for the KKK, or all of Nigeria responsible for Boko Haram. 

HOWEVER. Those countries do not fund those groups. America simply ignores the Klan, and Nigeria actively opposes and fights BH. Israel does nothing of the sort. They are actually in support of the settlers through their actions. Everyone is so focused on Hamas when there is a state-sponsored terrorist enclave with members in the Israeli government. These are people so insane that they're eyeing more land in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Egypt once they're done with the Palestinians. And I cannot stress this enough, THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN FUNDING AND PROTECTING THEM FOR DECADES. 

I'm honestly tired of conversations about this conflict leaving them out. It's like a massive elephant in the room that nobody wants to deal with. Even the ICJ case didn't bother addressing them.

1dheal9,IsraelPalestine,"What else could have been done? Many criticisms of Israel and Zionism go back to how Israel was created. The Nakba and any discussion around it are reflections of this. What I don't hear from the anti-Zionist crowd is what the alternative should have been. Israel was created in 1947 by the UN partition plan, which set aside land for Jews and Arabs. While the resolution passed with a majority, the Arab states voted against it.

What should have been done at that point? Let's say the UN resolution required a consensus - that without complete agreement of all parties, nothing changes. These are the possibilities that come to mind:

Great Britain didn't want to administer the Mandate forever, so leaving them in charge wasn't an option. Could they have been required to continue to administer it? How would that have worked?

There had already been violence between Jews and Arabs, so creating a single state would have run the risk of degenerating into civil war, possibly with an even worse outcome than what we have today. It’s possible that the Jews would have carved out their own country anyway, and given the existing support at that time for a Jewish state, it might very well have been recognized by many other countries.  
  
Another option would have been a single state, administered and occupied by an international coalition under UN auspices. This would have amounted to a continuation of the Mandate, except not under exclusive British control, with the goal of eventual withdrawal and handing over the area to a combined Jewish/Arab government once both sides demonstrated the willingness and ability to live in peace. How long could this reasonably have continued before the countries contributing to the occupying force would have given up and left?  
  
I realize this is hypothetical, but are there any other alternatives supported by historical facts that might have been plausible? I’m asking because anyone critical of Israel’s creation or who thinks it never should have been created in the first place should at least provide some reasonable alternatives.",,

# “I feel like I failed as a mother”: The impact on pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers



Her supply of breastmilk began to be severely reduced at the end of April, and with no access to breast pumps and extremely limited access to maternal supplements, she stressed the physical and emotional pain of trying for hours to breastfeed her infant but “milk would just not come out.” The family’s daily meal, when available, consists of one shared plate of lentils or eggplants with water, with S prioritizing her toddler. Her children fall asleep “weeping out of sheer hunger.” 



I fear miscarriage, but I also think about my baby: I panic just thinking about the potential impact of my own hunger on the baby’s health, its weight, whether it will have \[birth defects\], and even if the baby is born healthy, what life awaits it, amidst displacement, bombs, tents…



Her son, weakened by hunger, would “walk and fall.” “I feel like I failed as a mother; your children’s hunger makes you feel like you are a bad mother.”



Humanitarian workers at two organizations who spoke to Amnesty International on condition of anonymity mentioned that their organizations’ requests to bring in antibiotics were rejected by the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), a unit at Israel’s Ministry of Defense tasked with processing requests for the coordination and approval of entry of supplies.



“I had to go there because I have nobody to look after me. I saw with my own eyes people carrying bags of flour stained with the blood of those who had just been shot; even people I knew were almost unrecognizable. The experience of hunger and war has changed Gaza completely; it has changed our values.”



“I feel like I have become a burden on my family. When we were displaced, they had to push me on a wheelchair. With toilet queues extremely long in the camp where we stay, I need adult diapers, which are extremely expensive. I need medication for diabetes, blood pressure and a heart condition, and have had to take medicine which has expired. I always feel like these young children, they are the ones who deserve to live, my grandchildren. I feel like I’m a burden on them, on my son.”",,

18pdu8d,IsraelPalestine,"Can the United States help Israel borrow troops from India? If Israel were to escalate the war to a significant scale and suffer significant military defeats, both the United States and Israel would face a challenging situation. In theory, the United States could intervene directly, but Washington might not have the political determination to do so. In such a scenario, it could be beneficial for Israel to borrow a large number of troops from another country to handle internal defense, allowing their own forces to focus primarily on external operations. This could potentially enhance Israel's combat capabilities.

Where could these troops be borrowed from? I believe India could be a consideration. After all, India has abundant military resources, and borrowing over 100,000 troops at once is not entirely out of the realm of possibility. Additionally, there is favorable public sentiment in India towards providing military support to Israel. Of course, it would not be easy for India to make such a decision, as it would involve potential casualties and strain their relations with the Middle East.

I would suggest that the United States propose the following exchange conditions to India. If India is willing to send 100,000 troops to Israel for internal defense, then the United States can offer the following:

1. If India conducts nuclear tests, the United States will not impose sanctions.

2. If Pakistan follows India's nuclear tests with their own, the United States will impose sanctions on Pakistan.

3. Within the capabilities of the United States, prioritize discounted oil and gas supplies to India (with a higher priority than Europe, Japan, and South Korea).

4. The United States will assist India in suppressing Indian separatist forces and anti-Modi activists operating overseas. For example, the United States can provide crucial intelligence on various Indian separatist forces operating in Canada and grant Indian intelligence personnel licenses to carry out targeted killings in Canada.

By offering these conditions, the United States would also incur some losses. However, it may still be worth it when it comes to the crucial moment for Israel. Whether India accepts these conditions or not is uncertain, but it would be worth a try for the United States.",,

Corey is trying to have two non English speaking people explain things to English watchers. This already is a difficult thing to do. A lot of the times he asks them in english and then they speak in broken English unable to convey what they mean. Then he tells his translators ""ask them in Arabic/Hebrew"" 

But then we have his translators who seem to be so done with their job that they just translate things wrongly just to ""get the job done"" and a lot of the time, the translation is done so poorly and so badly that it twists the meaning to the point of actually doing a lot of harm. 

An example is stuff like he asks something in english, then his translator doesn't bother to understand the question well so they just ask it in a very literal way.  What i mean is as an example, Corey asks ""What do you think of Israel"" then the translator says ""What do you think of the jews"" so normally the person asked will say ""Arabs and Jews lived side by side for a long time"" so the translator will tell Corey ""they are saying they're fine with Israel being here"" / another instance is the translator saying ""what do you think of the occupiers"" in which the answer would be a lot more aggressive like ""we wish they all go away"" to which the careless translator says ""they think the Jews should leave"" 

This is very common with his Palestinian translator who goes by the name Mon Ami. She always asks the wrong questions and seems to be very very condensing in her questions, she seems to just do it for the money and not really caring much about what she was asking and what was the subject. A lot of times she doesn't even ask the same questions as Corey himself and sometimes  says condensing things like ""it's a stupid question... so bear with me""  or the person says a lot of things and all the translator says ""so they are saying some irrelevant stuff like"" and then gives a very brief phrase to finish quickly also speaks a lot of double meaning words that an Arab speaker would understand the wrong way. 

This is not just from Mon Ami. But also editors he probably hired that translated a lot of hebrew words wrongly, example is when asked about should Israel nuke Gaza. What a hebrew speaker said is ""Sababa"" which is equivalent of saying ""you know?"" As in ""you get me?"" That you say at the end of the sentence. But it was translated to sound like the Hebrew speaker was saying ""that's awesome!"" as if the Israeli guy is saying ""great! we nuke them!"" 

If something sounds a little too extreme. It is most probably not translated well. So keep that in mind when watching that channel. There is a lot of damage that it is causing and its all preventable. But the creator probably doesn't care as he is making money.",,

Every now and then israel creat a new area in palestinians land gaza and west Bank and they build hundreds of houses to israeliens there and they encourage them to live in this palestinians lands if israel stick to 1968 borders which almost 90% of countries today support there would be no problem but now israel want to control all palestine hell even egypte and Lebanon since Benjamin natinyaho believes in some lies in his old book which telling him that israeliens should take all this lands loool yet they tell us that israel is a country secularism country hhhhhhh dude it's same  as Afghanistan both are controlled with lies and stupid religions both of them are awful but Afghanistan doesn't take other countries lands as far as I know

As u all know or u should know israel didn't exist till 1948 so before 1948 there was no israel after that with support of England and usa they created this country ofc so England and usa can benefit from creating conflicts in middle east to control it easly and also they need an ally there so israel seems like a good investment

But some people are telling us that no jews people back then buyed lot of lands from palestinians and they had right to creat new country(hhhhh)

Let me ask u since there's millions of Muslims in usa and Canada and they have lot of houses and lands do they have right to make new country?? Ofc not do why it's ok for israel???",,

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHQXj-PYlm4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHQXj-PYlm4)

IDF/Shin Bet say these Palestinians were planning an attack.  
Validating the claim is near impossible, especially given credibility of both IDF and Shin Bet.  
In any event, all three enjoyed protected person civilian status at the time of their killing.

&gt;In armed conflicts of an international character, however, it must be kept in mind  
that ""civilians shall be protected from any acts of violence (Arts. 13 and 27 GC IV;  
Art. 46 HagueReg23)"" 24 and that in case of doubt as to whether a person is a civilian  
or a combatant he or she shall be treated as a civilian Art. 501 in ne AP I  
References to suspected terrorists are often based on missing reliable and public  
evidence of the commission or preparation of terrorist acts (making it impossible to  
challenge the validity of this presumption in a court of law). This categorisation also  
indicates that those persons are civilians or that at least there are doubts about their  
status. Therefore, they are entitled to be treated as civilians.

&amp;#x200B;

In this post, I will try to highlight some of the war crimes the Israeli special forces might've committed

War Crime 1-Hospital:

Israel’s attack wasn’t only distinct disrespect of the hospital’s sanctity, but brazen disregard for very restrictive prohibitions: not being the object of attack.

&gt;Article 18 – Wounded and - sick III. Protection of hospitals  
Civilian hospitals organized to give care to the wounded and sick, the infirm and maternity cases, may in no circumstances be the object of attack, but shall at all times be respected and protected by the Parties to the conflict.

&amp;#x200B;

War Crime 2-Extrajudicial Killing:

Two of the Palestinians were said to have been **unarmed and sleeping** at the time of their execution.

&gt;Article 27, Geneva Convention IV provides that protected persons shall be “protected especially against all acts of violence”.

&amp;#x200B;

War Crime 3-Hors de Combat:

This IMO is the worst one, if you want to know how bad it is Sgt Blackman, a Brit marine, was convicted of murdering an Afghan under this crime in 2013. The first Brit since WWII. That level of egregious.

&gt;Article 3 common to all four Conventions (1949): This article, present in each of the four main Geneva Conventions, prohibits violence against persons ""taking no active part in the hostilities,"" including those ""placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause."" While not defining ""hors de combat"" explicitly, it establishes their protected status.

&amp;#x200B;

War Crime 4-Perfidy:

By disguising themselves as seemingly harmless, protected medical personnel and civilians, the Israeli forces also prima facie committed the war crime of perfidy, which is prohibited in all circumstances

&gt;While the act itself doesn't have a specific designation or ban within international law, it falls under the broader category of ""perfidy"" which is prohibited under Article 37(1)(a) of Additional Protocol I. Perfidy involves acts of trickery or deception that violate the good faith expected in armed conflict.

&amp;#x200B;

Additional Violations:

The targeted killing of all three compounds in appreciating additional rights afford them, namely;  
\- The Right to Life (Article 6 ICCPR which Israel is signatory)  
\- The Right to Fair Trial (Article 14 ICCPR)  
Israel deprived all three of both while committing war crimes.

&gt;**The targeted killing of persons suspected of performing terrorist activities is not compatible with the right to life and to a due process**, neither in peacetime nor within the context of armed conflicts, may they be of an international character or of a non-international character. In order to promote the dignity of the person, IHL protects combatants and civilians taking part in hostilities from arbitrary and unlawful deprivation of life. It determines that these persons shall be punished only after adequate judicial procedures, put in place to assess violations of IHL or criminal responsibility, for engaging in hostilities without being entitled to do so, for war crimes, or for common crimes. Moreover, the civilian population in general is also

1hca6zk,IsraelPalestine,"ICC prosecutor comment on Gaza medical facilities My position on the conflict is clear. I recognize Israel's right to defend itself against the onslaught of Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah and the ultimate goal of the destruction of the Jewish state. I believe that Hamas as an organization should be eliminated and no longer be part of the future of Gaza.  Today I read about a statement by a senior prosecutor of the ICC. The ICC may not be a friend of Israel, but I would like to go into that topic. Andrew Cayley is a British lawyer working as a prosecutor at the ICC for the investigation into war crimes on both sides. He recently said at a conference in The Hague that reports about hospitals and medical infrastructure used militarily by Hamas seem exaggerated to him. According to Cayley, the ICC has very good satellite images of the physical condition, ie damage or destruction of the facilities, but little convincing data on military use. I believe that Israel must make a great effort to prove this point. It is another matter whether the truth is believed or not. Using medical facilities in warfare is presented as a  main indication of Hamas fighting behind a civilian shield. Israel cannot provide enough clarity about this. Israel must do everything it can to bring the facts to light. I would like to hear the opinion of other members of this sub on this. Thanks.

1ei7nyk,IsraelPalestine,"Strike killing WCK workers deemed accident According to independent australian research, the strike on a wck vehicle that was transporting goods, was an accident.

For those who havent heard about this incident or forgot, the truck was one amongst a convoy of 3 vehicles that had just delivered supplies to a storage facility in deir-al balah when it got hit by an israeli airstrike. 

7 people passed away as a result of this strike, amongst wich a palestinian driver and polish, british and australian humanitarian aid workers.

According to the australian air force officer that was sent to investigate the incident, the israeli airforce misidentified the armed guards that were also in the vehicle to protect the workers, as terrorists who had captured the vehicle and decided to launch a strike.

Besides that, due to a communication issue, local IDF forces were not fully aware of the fact that a WCK convoy was moving trough the area, wich likely gave the commanding officers more reason to be suspicious of the convoy.

According to the australian minister of foreign affairs, the personnel responsible for this strike should be held responsible for this occurence, even potentially by proscecution if it is deemed nessecary. She has also said that tjis was not a singular occurence, with 250 humanitarian aid workers now killed in the duration of this conflict and she states that there should be more done to secure the safety of humanitarian workers.

As for my opnion on this,

I personally definetly disagree with how israel has handled this conflict for the most part, but i do think that they handled this incident very well, by allowing the precense of an indepent researcher and by (assumably) being very transparent with the officer, this case could be resolved quite quickly and efficiently, and i do hope they resolve more incidents in this manner.

I do however also agree with the australian minister on the fact the the peesonnel responsible should be held accountible. Even if it was a mistake, it was one that cost the lives of seven people and getting off with that spot free is not right, although any kind of reprecussion in the form of jail time or anything like that does seem a bit harsh to me.

1j4gfsy,IsraelPalestine,"Israel &amp; Palestinians Need PCIT - Parent / Child Interactive Therapy [PCIT](https://pcit-training-online.com/) is a known methodology for improving the relationship between parent and child. It is focused on:

1. Gradually establishing clear consequences for not listening.
2. Requiring consistency.



It all comes down to establishing the clear knowledge of consequences that follows ""It's time to practice listening. Please pick up your clothes by the time I count to 10, or you will get a time-out"". 

And you every time, you have to hold strong. If your child does not actually listen, they have to get a time-out. And stay in time-out until they are willing to do the task.

The training for this is hard at first - the child will fight back, go to timeout and refuse to calm down and finish the task. But it is worth it - after a few times (and being consistent) they get the message - you mean what you say.

The next time you say ""it's time to practice listening"" they'll really start listening. it's amazing. They'll fuss all up to that point, but once you hit the routine, they know the routine too. And they don't want the consequences.

  
You can't just go around shouting random threats - they won't take you seriously. Like Trump tweeting this is Hamas ""last chance"" for like the 3rd time now. Terrible parenting, the kids won't take you seriously.

  
How do you handle Hamas and Palestinians? You need to be consistent and have a consequence they don't want to endure over and over. In my mind, this is the threat of displacement out of Palestine (but you may suggest a better one).

  
Israel has to be clear and consistent - each time a Palestinian attacks an Israeli, 10,000 Palestinians will be displaced to somewhere else. Or, Israel will take 1,000 acres of land. Whatever it is, it has to be stated, and be consistent.

Palestinians need to know what will happen - not some vague threats, not doing nothing one time, then bombing them like crazy another time. This doesn't train them to have a healthy response.

The first few times they will test the boundaries, and Israel has to be consistent in seizing land. Then they will clearly know the cost to their actions.

I have full confidence that this method works. However, what truly is the action that would make Palestinians regret their decisions to not have peace?

If the US had lost those numbers would likely be at least reversed.  This is what it means to lose a war: far more of your people die than the other side.

It's worth remembering that the Japanese civilian loss of life was mostly avoidable, if the US were willing to put it's troops more at risk.  It wasn't, and were you the general in charge you would have made the same call.  Or you would have been removed from command for being a traitorous idiot.

The US gave the Japanese a choice: surrender or we'll kill hundreds of thousand to millions more civilians.  We're not risking our troops for your lives.

Japan surrendered and possibly millions of lives were saved.  This has always been Hamas' option.  It's always been Hamas' choice to continue a war they cannot win.

I hope we can stop, at least here, making the utterly idiotic argument that the losing side is somehow entitled to equal deaths on both sides.  The losing side can stop dying at any point when it surrenders.

1m3f6hg,IsraelPalestine,"the mass displacement let's start with the usual reminder, this conflict isn't about ""settlements"" or ""apartheid"", this conflict isn't even about gaza and the west bank.

in 1947 there was the UN partition plan which the jews agreed to, the partition plan would have made it possible for 2 states to co-exist without any need for displacements, a Jewish majority country and another arab muslim country (if they didn't have enough) in the territory of the former British mandate of Palestine.

the arabs rejected, started a war and as a result of that war and the territorial changes, displacements of Palestinians and also jews occurred.

but of course it didn't end there, the UN founded UNRWA which made it their purpose to prolong the conflict until it's resolved on their terms(no Jewish state) by pumping up refugees(refugee status can't end until they are back in ""their"" lands and the status is passed down to children) instead of solving refugee issues and co-operating with terrorists entities to destroy israel.

throughout 1948-1967 (when the west bank was under jordan control and gaza was under Egypt control) arab countries and ""Palestinians"" attacked israel relentlessly, which means the west bank and gaza definitely aren't the issue in this conflict.

pro ""Palestinians"" justify these actions with their altered term ""nakba"" from the propaganda script.

regardless, does it really justify these actions? there are tons of wars where people were diplaced to never return but they don't put suicide vests on themselves because of that.

Between 850,000 and 1,000,000 Jews were expelled from Middle East/North Africa (MENA) countries after 1948 with little more than the clothes on their backs. The amount of assets stolen from them is estimated at up to $250Billion, including land more than 5 times the size of Israel.

(we didn't get a shekel of course and no acknowledgment of responsibility)

so if the expulsion of around 700k ""Palestinians"" in 1948, (where many have returned) justifies all they did, then what does the obviously worse expulsion of jews from the middle eastern countries justify?

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how the only real way to make a difference in this conflict might be through actual communication. The kind of conversation where you strip away all the labels, all the politics, and just speak as human beings. It’s not about agreeing on everything or solving the conflict overnight, but about understanding each other a little better.

There’s so much history and pain on both sides. It feels impossible sometimes to bridge that gap. But when it’s anonymous—no names, no faces, just two people talking without the usual baggage—there’s a chance to break down some of those walls. At the end of the day, we’re all just people. We all want similar things: safety, peace, a future for our kids.

The usual methods haven’t been getting us anywhere. Negotiations, ceasefires, protests, even war, have all been tried, and yet the cycle continues. War may be a short term solution but the long term conflict will not be solved. Something different is needed. Creating empathy and understanding, even in small amounts, could be a first step toward change. Seeing the other side as human beings with real feelings and struggles could lead to something better.

That’s why I created a chat application. It’s a small platform where people from both sides can come together, maybe to debate or argue, maybe just to get to know each other, it's your choice. An anonymous chat between two people. It won’t end the conflict, but it might be a step in the right direction. If it can help even a few people see things differently, then it’s worth it.

If you’re feeling curious or just tired of the way things are, give it a try. The person on the other side may not be so different after all.

1c2xsiu,IsrealPalestineWar_23,"Simplified Report on the Historical Context of Israel’s Creation and Impact of Colonial Legacies The state of Israel was established in 1948, a decision made through a plan proposed by the United Nations following World War II. This event has deeply influenced the politics of the Middle East, especially the ongoing conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. This report explores how Israel was created, the reasons behind the UN’s decisions, and how these decisions are part of a larger pattern where historically powerful countries (mostly in the Global North) have influenced international outcomes.

**Creation of Israel and UN Partition Plan**

After World War II, Britain decided to end its control over Palestine and handed over the responsibility to the United Nations (UN). The UN formed a group called the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP) to find a solution. UNSCOP suggested dividing Palestine into two separate states, one for Jews and one for Arabs, with Jerusalem being managed internationally because of its religious importance.

The committee included representatives from eleven countries. Despite their diversity, many were from Western nations where the majority of the population was white. The partition plan was more about demographic (population distribution) and economic factors than about military strategy.

**Geopolitical Influences and Voting Dynamics**

The UN General Assembly voted for the partition plan on November 29, 1947. Both the USA and the USSR, the two most powerful countries at the time, supported the plan. Their support shows how strategic interests (like influencing the Middle East) were as crucial as humanitarian concerns (like providing a safe home for Jews after the Holocaust) in their decision to back the plan.

The significant support from predominantly white countries in this vote highlights a trend where Western interests often dominated UN decisions at that time, impacting political outcomes far from their own regions.

**Legacy of Colonialism and Its Ongoing Effects**

The methods and outcomes of the partition plan reflect a larger, historical pattern known as colonialism, where powerful countries establish control over less powerful regions, often to exploit resources. This has left a lasting impact on global politics and economics:

* **Economic and Political Dominance**: Even after colonies gained independence, economic tactics, political pressures, and sometimes military interventions have maintained the dominance of former colonial powers.
* **Cultural Hegemony and Social Structures**: Western culture continues to influence and sometimes replace local cultures and social norms through media, products, and language, a phenomenon known as cultural imperialism.

**Military and Strategic Interests**

The strategic interests that motivated colonialism are visible today in the form of military bases around the world, interventions in foreign conflicts, and the strategic manipulation of international law to favor powerful countries. These tactics mirror colonial-era strategies to maintain control over global affairs.

**Conclusion**

The creation of Israel and the implementation of its statehood involved a mix of humanitarian reasons and strategic interests, particularly from countries in the Global North. These patterns of influence have evolved from direct colonial control to more subtle forms of influence but continue to significantly affect international relations and contribute to ongoing global inequalities and conflicts. Understanding these patterns is crucial for recognizing how past decisions shape current events.

This simplified report provides a clear overview meant for a global audience about how historical and geopolitical factors have influenced the creation of Israel and continue to impact global politics. The focus is on explaining complex international relations dynamics in an accessible manner.",,

The Early Zionists went directly to the Ottoman Sultan, [to obtain a proper colonial charter:](https://www.newspapers.com/article/the-jewish-voice/135984461/)  


&gt;""Dr. Theodore Hertzle, president of the Zionist congress, who, in his annual address, referred to the Sultan's persistent refusal to grant a charter for the colonization of Palestine""

When the Sultan refused, they simply sought help from other imperial powers to support them in settling Palestine and their quest for a Jewish State there.  


Ze'ev Jabotinsky is [the most publicaly commemorated Zionist leader in Israel today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ze%27ev_Jabotinsky#:~:text=In%20Israel%2C%2057%20streets%2C%20parks,sphere%20of%20literature%20and%20research). He is listed on the [Likud Party's website](https://www.likud.org.il/en/about-the-likud/former-leaders/zeev-jabotinsky) as a ""Former Leader"" and is pretty much the ideological fountainhead of modern Zionism today, a hero to Israeli politicians and Prime Ministers from Menachem Begin, to Ariel Sharon, and Netanyahu.  


Jabotinsky clearly and forcefully explained what the Zionists were doing in 1923:  


&gt;Zionist colonization, even the most restricted, must either be terminated or carried out in defiance of the will of the native population. This colonization can, therefore, continue and develop only under the protection of a force independent of the local population – an iron wall which the native population cannot break through. **This is, in toto, our policy towards the Arabs.** To formulate it any other way would only be hypocrisy.

The ""iron Wall"" he's talking about is, of course, imperial Britain.  


Then there is the fact that, when the British put forth the 1939 White Paper, the Zionists rejected the paper and launched into a series of terrorist attacks that eventually drove the british out after WWII. What did the White paper propose? A state for both Arabs and Jews to share together in a representative government. The arabs rejoiced and accepted the proposal. The Zionists refused. Because they did not want a fair, representative democracy within an Arab majority. They wanted the whole land to become a jewish state with a Jewish majority, achieved via settler ""colonies"" that would in time make them the dominant majority at the expense of the Arabs.  


So it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, *introduces itself as a duck,* and speaks of itself being a duck...But we're supposed to ignore all this and say that this is all a big mistake and misunderstand. It is not at all, a duck. I'm sorry, I strive to be open-minded but the facts presented above have too much force to ignore.",,

1l6hkwa,IsraelPalestine,"Israel shouldn't exist - Brief History + Extras It's history time kids!!!
Zionism Before the Holocaust
Jewish Zionists wanting to settle in Palestine was a plan before the Holocaust.
The Zionist movement formally began in the late 19th century, notably with Theodor Herzl’s publication of Der Judenstaat in 1896.
• Herzl and other early Zionists believed that Jews constituted a nation in exile and required a homeland to escape European antisemitism.
• The First Zionist Congress was held in 1897 in Basel, Switzerland, where the goal was articulated: establishing a legally recognized Jewish homeland in Palestine.

British Involvement and the Balfour Declaration (1917)
• In 1917, during WWI, the British government issued the Balfour Declaration, expressing support for a ""national home for the Jewish people"" in Palestine.
• After WWI, Britain received the League of Nations Mandate to govern Palestine and facilitate this policy.
• Palestinian Arabs (majority) were excluded from decisions.
• Tensions escalated with increased Jewish immigration, leading to several revolts and uprisings.

The Holocaust and Pressure for a Jewish State
• Although Zionism was already well established, the Holocaust (1941–1945) drastically shifted global support.
• Six million Jews were killed by Nazi Germany creating global sympathy and pressure for a Jewish State
• After WWII, Palestine was seen as the only viable refuge for displaced Jews.

UN Partition Plan &amp; Creation of Israel (1947–1948)
• In 1947, the UN proposed partitioning Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states.
• Jewish leaders accepted the plan; Arab leaders rejected it.
• On May 14, 1948, David Ben-Gurion declared the State of Israel.
• Surrounding Arab nations invaded, starting the First Arab-Israeli War.

The Nakba (1947–1949)
""Nakba"" = “Catastrophe” in Arabic.
The mass displacement and dispossession of Palestinians during Israel’s establishment.
Summary:
• 700,000–750,000 Palestinians displaced
• 10,000–15,000 Palestinians killed
• 400+ villages depopulated/destroyed
• Key events:
• UN Partition Plan (Nov 1947)
• Civil war escalation (Dec 1947–May 1948)
• Israeli independence (May 14, 1948)
• Mass expulsions (1948–49)
• Notable massacres: Deir Yassin, Lydda, Ramle

Albert Einstein and Israel
• In 1952, Einstein was offered the presidency of Israel.
• He declined.
• In a 1948 letter, he warned against Israeli nationalism and its treatment of Palestinians — fearing resemblance to oppressive regimes.
(What kind of regime could he possibly be referring to?)

Systematic Killing of Palestinians (Before Oct 7th)
Major Killings:
• 1956 Suez Crisis – Hundreds killed
• 1982 Sabra &amp; Shatila – Indirect Israeli responsibility
• 1987–1993 First Intifada – Several hundred deaths
• 2002 Operation Defensive Shield – ~500 killed
• 2008–09 Cast Lead – 1,400+ killed
• 2012 Pillar of Defense – ~160 killed
• 2014 Protective Edge – 2,200+ killed
• 2018 Great March of Return – 200+ killed
• 2021 May Gaza Conflict – 250+ killed
• 2022 Raids/Strikes – Hundreds killed

Palestinian Prisoners (Before Oct 7th):
• 4,500–5,000 Palestinians detained, including
• 500–600 administrative detainees (no charges)
• These include children detainees

War Crimes
1. Illegal Israeli Settlements
Expansion and maintenance of settlements in occupied Palestinian territories (West Bank, East Jerusalem) declared illegal by the International Court of Justice (2004 advisory opinion) and UN Security Council Resolutions (e.g., 2334 in 2016).

2. Construction of the Separation Barrier (Wall)
Declared illegal by the ICJ (2004) where it extends into occupied territory, violating international humanitarian law.

3. Disproportionate Attacks and Indiscriminate Use of Force
UN reports and OHCHR investigations have documented multiple incidents where Israeli military operations in Gaza caused disproportionate civilian deaths and damage (e.g., 2008-09 Cast Lead, 2014 Protective Edge, 2021 Gaza conflict).

4. Attacks on Protected Objects and Civilians
Strikes on UN shelters, hospitals, schools (documented in UN and human rights reports) violating the principle of distinction under international humanitarian law.

5. Collective Punishment through Blockade of Gaza
The land, air, and sea blockade imposed on Gaza since 2007 is considered by many international bodies (including UN experts) as collective punishment prohibited by international law.

6. Forced Displacement and Home Demolitions
Demolition of Palestinian homes in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, including punitive demolitions and those linked to settlement expansion, violating the Fourth Geneva Convention.

7. Administrative Detention and Torture
Use of administrative detention without charge or trial, including of minors; documented torture and ill-treatment of Palestinian detainees reported by UN committees and human rights groups.

8. Use of Live Fire Against Protesters
Killings and injuries of unarmed Palestinian protesters during events such as the Great March of Return (2018-2019), criticized as excessive and unlawful use of force.

9. Extrajudicial Executions
Targeted killings without judicial process of Palestinians suspected of militant activities, violating due process rights.

10. Restrictions on Movement and Access
Severe restrictions on Palestinians’ freedom of movement within the West Bank and Gaza, including checkpoints and the separation barrier, impacting access to healthcare, education, and livelihoods.

11. Destruction of Agricultural and Economic Resources
Confiscation or destruction of Palestinian agricultural lands, olive trees, and infrastructure tied to settlements and military operation.

12. Denial of Access to Adequate Water and Sanitation
Restrictions on Palestinian access to water resources in the occupied territories, violating international human rights and humanitarian l

13. Discrimination Against Palestinian Citizens of Israel
Institutional discrimination affecting rights related to land, housing, and political participation recognized by human rights organizations.

Investigations and Legal Actions
International Criminal Court (ICC): Investigating multiple aspects of Israel’s conduct since 2014, including settlement activity and military operations in Gaza.

United Nations Human Rights Council: Multiple commissions of inquiry have found evidence consistent with war crimes and called for accountability.

Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, B’Tselem: Extensive documentation and legal analysis supporting claims of war crimes and rights violations.

Hamas and Israeli Involvement
Funding via Qatar (2012–2021)
Between 2012 and 2021, Israel allowed Qatar to transfer over $1.5 billion into Gaza, which funded Hamas salaries and governance under Israeli supervision. This strategy aimed to weaken the Palestinian Authority and manage Hamas’s power as a political tool, despite the risk of empowering a militant group.

October 7th: Intelligence Failure or Israeli allowed attack to justify a genocide
Myself and others, including intelligence insiders, believe the 6–8 hour unimpeded attack is not just a failure, but a historic anomaly that defies the usual capabilities of Israel’s defense system.

• Israel's military and surveillance capabilities are world-class
• Yet a 6–8 hour assault happened with no intervention?

Surveillance Infrastructure:
1. Border Fence Tech
• Smart Border Fence
• A high-tech barrier built along the Gaza Strip (65+ km long) Equipped with:
• Ground sensors (vibration, seismic)
• Motion detectors
• Thermal cameras
•  Day/night vision cameras
•  Radars for tracking movement
B. Remote-Controlled Weapon Stations
• ""Sentry Tech"" system,
• automated machine guns linked to observation posts operated remotely with real-time video feed from surveillance towers
• Often paired with AI-assisted target tracking.
Watch Towers &amp; Surveillance Posts
• Dozens of towers along the border, with:
•  360-degree high-resolution cameras
•  Thermal infrared imaging systems
•  Night vision
•  Microphone sensors

2. Drones / Balloons / Satellites
• Tethered balloons with radar and cameras, they provide wide-area thermal and video surveillance, high altitude, persistent monitoring
C. Satellite Surveillance
• Israel has military satellites (e.g., Ofek series) for:
• Monitoring troop and vehicle movement
• Detecting heat signatures (thermal anomalies)
• Drones (UAVs)
• Continuous drone coverage over Gaza, including: Heron, Hermes 450/900, Elbit Skylark
Capabilities:
• Thermal imaging
•  High-res optical zoom
•  Facial recognition (via AI)
•  Real-time video stream to IDF command

3. SIGINT / Cyber Surveillance
• Systems like “Lavender” and “The Gospel” (exposed in 2024 leaks) Identify targets via AI and big data
• Can autonomously mark phones or homes for strikes
• Use voice, movement, call frequency, SIM card data to detect threats

Electronic and Signal Intelligence (SIGINT)
• A. Cyber &amp; Communications Intercepts
• Monitors Hamas communications, mobile networks, encrypted apps
• Uses AI to flag suspicious patterns in metadata

4. Human Surveillance
• Facial Recognition at Crossings
• At Erez and other checkpoints
• Live biometric scanning for workers and civilians entering Israel

B. Palestinian Informants
Israel’s security agency (Shin Bet) has historically recruited informants within Gaza and the West Bank
This supplements digital intelligence

5. Integrated Command
•  All surveillance feeds converge in IDF Southern Command HQ and Unit 8200 (Israel’s equivalent of the NSA)
• Real-time AI alert systems flag:
• Unusual movement on the fence
• Heat signatures
• Breaches or destruction of sensors

Conclusion: Why Didn’t They Act?
• Any mass movement of people, bulldozers, or paragliders near or at the fence should have triggered immediate alerts. It's almost unfeasible that the attack went ""undetected"" despite warnings from Egypt and Isrsel knowing the summary of what the attack would be years prior.

Why Israel is Fundamentally a Bad Idea
Creating a state around a single religion or ethnic identity, even when cloaked in secular governance, consistently leads to radicalism, exclusion, and often violence for several reasons: 

1. In Group vs Out Group Mentality
• Jewish identity as basis excludes others
• Radical nationalism rises
• When a state defines itself by one identity (e.g., ""Jewish state"", ""Islamic Republic""), it automatically others everyone else minorities become second class, even if granted formal rights.
• This fosters radical nationalism to ""protect"" the identity group and suppress dissent.

2. It demands Constant Defense
• Threat narrative = Justification for oppressionEthno-religious states often feel existentially threatened by demographics, dissent, or neighbors.
• That fear justifies:
• Militarization
• Surveillance of minorities
• Suppressing internal critique
In Israel’s case: a constant narrative of existential threat has justified decades of occupation and repression.

3. Breeds Extremism
• When the state and religion/ethnicity are fused, radicals claim to speak for the state or faith.
• In Israel, messianic settlers and ultranationalists now influence policy.
• The same happened in:
• Pakistan (rise of Taliban-like extremism)
• India (Hindutva and anti-Muslim policies)
• Iran (hardline Shia theocracy)

4. Demographic Engineering
• Controls Palestinian demographics (e.g. through blockade, exile, settlements)
• Denies equal rights to millions under occupation.

Israel is a real-time case study of how founding a state on a singular ethno religious identity, in a multiethnic region, has led to radicalization, apartheid like conditions, and endless conflict.

Final Word
Israel is a Zionist-created state, not representative of all Jews.
• Founded through violence and dispossession
• Committed systematic killings
• Instigated conflicts
• Funded Hamas
• Took hostages pre-Oct 7th
• Tortured prisoners
It should be abolished.

I understand that they are more dangerous, but are we not allowed to cry? We must also not be sad just because in Gaza they are poorer? People who shout from the river to the sea don't understand that this means a second holocaust? People say it's about a humane section, but what they did to us is not humane? Because Hamas hides behind civilians it has immunity and Israel is not allowed to respond?

Recently, I came across something that really caught my attention: before the modern state of Israel was established, there were actually discussions about other possible locations for a Jewish homeland — including Argentina and Uganda. I had no idea this was ever seriously considered, and it made me realize just how complex and far-reaching the history really is.



That led me to read more about Britain’s involvement in the region, especially during the Mandate period after World War I. The Balfour Declaration in 1917, where the British government expressed support for a “national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine, seems to have played a major role in setting the stage for the decades of conflict that followed. Britain administered the territory for years, and its decisions clearly had long-term consequences — for both Jewish and Arab communities.



What adds to the confusion is how, around the same time, Britain also made promises to Arab leaders — suggesting support for an independent Arab state if they helped defeat the Ottoman Empire. From what I’ve read, this left many Arab communities feeling betrayed when those promises weren’t honored. It feels like Britain was trying to please multiple sides without a clear long-term plan, and the people living in the region paid the price.



What I’m wondering is: why doesn’t the UK receive more attention or criticism for its historical role in all this? I’d appreciate any insight or resources people might be willing to share.",,

So I am Jewish and live in America, I grew up attending synagogue and Hebrew school, and I was always taught (and believed!) that we should feel grateful to Israel because it protects Jews all around the world. We had Israeli soldiers visit our Hebrew school to feel more connected to them. Everybody around me growing up never questioned the state of Israel at all and how it protects us, here in the Northeast of America.  

I went on Birthright (a bunch of years ago) and was very disillusioned by visiting Israel. I was very uncomfortable with the idea that l, an American who had never been there before, would be welcomed to move there (and actively encouraged to) while people who were born in the same place have been violently exiled and not allowed to return to their homes.

I have been told again and again that Jews around the world need Israel's protection, but I have never understood how having a country with a big military is protecting us. I understand that it provides refuge in the case of persecution, but I'm not sure any (at least American) Jews are in need of a place to live currently due to being exiled/persecuted, or an extremely powerful army?

Is it just me, or is it strange to see two (fundamentally) religious groups using one’s lack of morality to justify the other’s immoral response?? 

To think that 5,000 years of religious belief, practice, and outward piety—got us this as a moral guidepost?

First, what exactly is a moral? 

I’m glad you asked. 

When used as a noun, Oxford describes a moral as,

“a person's standards of behavior or beliefs concerning what is and is not acceptable for them to do.”

Or, as an adjective,

“holding or manifesting high principles for proper conduct.”

And to ‘manifest’ is to,

“Be evidence of, demonstrate, prove.”

Or, in short, morality appears to be the outward demonstration or proof of the moral virtues you profess. 

This is where it would be better if we lost our ability to speak, for morality does not require words. One could argue any words used to defend one’s morality are proof that the morality you claimed—never existed to begin with. 

You see, morality isn’t an ingredient you sprinkle on something—it’s a foundation. It is hammered and forged over a lifetime. The only way a moral is ever truly tested is when faced with something so evil and immoral that your moral solution seems wholly inadequate to combat it. Then, and only then, will we find out if you will put your faith in a lifetime of work—or a moment of anger and fear.

17qtxo7,IsraelPalestine,"The dream of return to before 1957 I've seen some accounts on this forum post that their goal or hope for Palestinians is, roughly speaking, for a return to conditions before 1947, so roughly that most of the descendants of the 700k+ Palestinians displaced in the Nakba would return to the areas where they previously lived, and most of the Jewish people living in those areas would leave/vanish. I'm not saying that is entirely widespread on here, but vague statements gesturing in that direction are not entirely uncommon.

I just want to point out what a weird idea that would be if applied on a larger scale. Consider the fact that in central and eastern Europe  during that same period, the late 1940s following WWII, the various global powers, primarily the USA and USSR, engaged in vast population transfer forcibly displacing something on the scale of 20 to 30 million people. A very small portion of that was sending back Nazi colonists to Germany, but most of it was about making areas of Europe that had ALWAYS been ethnically heterogenous suddenly ethnically homogenous, out of the idea this would lead to a more lasting peace. Hell maybe it worked. But it brought untold suffering and death in the short term. Something like 13 million German speaking people were forcibly relocated (only maybe 1 million of them Nazi colonists to the east), and over 2 million of them died in transit. Around 1.5 million Poles and Ukrainians were forcibly relocated in order to have a more homogenous Ukraine and Poland. 

Imagine if the descendants of all these 20 to 30 million people who were forcibly relocated in the late 1940s in Europe demanded the right of return to their homes, and the evacuation of those who replaced them.

Prior to World War 2 the city of Lviv, also known as Lvov, had a population of half a million of whom half or 250,000 were Polish. After the population transfer there were very few Poles left in Lviv. Imagine if the descendants of nearly 250,000 Poles wanted to come back there? This is not a great comparison because I'm leaving out the mass deaths in WW2 in these numbers, but this is fanciful so you get the idea.

And of course there is also the question of what if all the Jewish people in Israel returned to the various countries in the Middle East and North Africa, and Europe and the former USSR, that they were driven out of and tried to reclaim their homes and other stolen property?

None of this is to say that some amount of land and economic redistribution could not and should not happen, nor that major reforms are not needed that can allow Palestinians to have greater peace, political autonomy, and economic prosperity. I'm just pointing out how ludicrous some of the ""return to before 1947"" people are in their weird rhetoric.",,

The Trump administration is working on a plan to permanently relocate as much as one million Palestinians from the Gaza Strip to Libya. I told ya Trump still very much want to realize his vision of Gaza Riviera. Knowing Trump, he is probably doing it for his own benefit. How likely is it that Netanyahu and Trump made a deal, if Trump can find a place to transfer out all the Palestinians in Gaza, Israel will handover Gaza to Trump?  But Netanyahu wont and cant wait, I do want needs to be done, try to eliminate Hamas, try to free hostages, you get back to me when you have a concrete plan to move over 2 million Palestians out of Gaza and then US can takeover and occupy Gaza, and can build his Riviera, golf course, luxury hotels, Trump towers, etc... while Netanyahu sets his eyes on the West Bank.

In exchange for resettling the Palestinians, the administration would release to Libya billions of dollars (my research indicated funds in excess of $30 billion) of funds the US froze more than a decade ago, according to NBC and citing the same three people.

Questions 

1. Which other country did Trump recently lift US sanctions ? Syria. Could Trump also have requested that Syria accepts more Palestinian refugees from Gaza ? If Trump can ask Libya to take in people from.Gaza, no reason why he cant ask Syria too. Pure speculations, maybe Syria doesnt want it to be publicized due to the senstivity of the issue. Syria is currently talking with Israel in Azerbaijan about another interesting development, Syria wants to  join the Abraham Accord. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.timesofisrael.com/report-israel-holding-talks-with-syria-on-sharaa-regime-joining-abraham-accords/amp/ Well he cant join with the war still raging on, wanna join ? help end the war, help release the hostages.

2. Lets forget ethnic cleansing for the only reason it has no legal definition and the phrase is not found in any international laws, conventions, treaties etc... its a new phrase coined in the 1990s during the Bosnian war, a literal translation of a Serbo-Croation phrase ""etnicko ciscenje"". While many of the international laws, conventions were written much older. But in international law, it is written about forced deportation, which I think is a close equivalent of ethnic cleansing, what do you think? 

3. Now since the word used was forced deportation, what if its not forced, it was voluntarily ? i know what you are thinking.... there are provisions in international law that allow voluntarily movement. In addition, you will noticed every NGO, humanitarian organization, UN, etc...only always say, but Israel as the occupying power has responsibilities... UN, ICJ does consider Israel as the occupying power of Gaza, long before Oct 7th. But ....what if the one doing the voluntarily population movement is not the occupying power ? USA is not the occupying power in Gaza, its just helping to faciliate people who wants to voluntarily move out of a war zone, there is nothing written that others (non-occupying powers), cant help. International law only said the Occupying Power cannot, what if its a non-occupying power ?

4. For the longest time, Egypt being the only other country bordering Gaza, has steadfast refused to allow Palestinians in to Egypt. Do you know if a Palestinian is in Egypt, they dont receive any help from UNRWA ? Egypt never had any UN refugee camps. And Jodan had also said No to more Palestinians from Gaza. The problem is not Palestinians not wanting to move out of Gaza, the problem as explained by Netanyahu is finding a country who will accept them. So what if there were other countries who would accept people from Gaza, these countries just want something else in return.... Israel cant offer much on the global stage, but USA has lots to offer and bargaining chips.... if Trump agrees to either Ukraine or Russia on a concession which might tilt the balance of war, will they seriously consider taking in some people from Gaza ?  I think they might... after all, I suspect they wont stay in Ukraine and Russia, once they are outside Gaza and have the paperworks, they will leave and go somewhere else..probably to Europe, US, Turkey. 

5. I read from a reliable source, some people in Gaza who chose to leave and with support from their family received helped from American Palestinians and successfully managed to leave, just a few days ago. I dont know the full details, but I heard Israel has setup a voluntarily migration program. It sounded alot like the 1969 (after the six day war of 1967), secret Israeli plan to encourage 60,000 Palestinians from Gaza to resettled in Paraguay.",,

This situation is underpinned by a complex web of mistrust and fear.   
  
    
On one hand, Hamas, which to my opinion is a terrorist organisation in its core of Leadership but a resistance movement in the minds of the many orphaned Gazans deluded to fight and avenge, governs the Gaza Strip in some form of Dictatorship that only adds to the suffering of the Gazan population, but is at the same time their only chance against Israel's need to expansion. Sinwar proved that Hamas does not care about its own population by admitting, just 2 weeks after the war that he will always keep attacking Israel, to prevent any doubt about continuing this war.   
  
    
On the other hand, the actions of the IDF, and their dehumanizing ways of conducting military operations in Gaza also show another form of a terrible terrorism inflicted on Palestinian civilians. These operations,  also contribute to the cycle of violence and retaliation, deepening the divide between the two populations.    
  
We all assume in that sub that there is a lot of innocent civilians in Gaza, used as Cannon powder by both Hamas leaders and the IDF. While the rest of the world is seeing them as people with lives and families, a lot of Pro-Israelis see them as numbers and describe their tragic deaths as collateral damage for a greater cause. This is for the first time documented and Israel is thinking, it can get away with it like the US, but lately how war is viewed by the world changed dramatically and the image Israel created is going to haunt it for the rest of its existence.    
  
Many Posts have been asking ""why gazans do not protest aginst Hamas ""!   
  
The answer lies in the West Bank, where the expansion of Israeli settlements accompanied by mistreatment, government allowed violence against people in their homes, residents being pushed out, further complicates the trust process. I don't think any reasonable person in this sub would blame palestinians for not trusting the Israeli government !   
  
 Israelis, also fear palestinians and do not trust them because of Hamas statements, and i do not blame them.   
  
This cycle of mistrust is further fueled by extremists elements on both sides.    
  
The question is : Why, all of this, is in any way some innocent palestinian child's fault ??",,

1d4vauo,IsraelPalestine,"Is Zionism a colonial movement? Zionists will often try to describe their movement as a quest for self-determination and statehood for the Jewish people in Palestine. [They will vehemently deny that Zionism is a form of colonialism](https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/allegation-israel-settler-colonialist-enterprise), invoking all kinds of arguments. I thought it would be interesting to see what early Zionist leaders had to say about Zionist being a colonial movement or not. I researched primary sources from pretty much all the major early Zionist figures I could find to see what they had to say. 

[Moses Montefiore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Montefiore) (1784 – 1885) was a British financier and banker, activist, philanthropist and Sheriff of London and one the early Zionist thinkers. He said during an interview in the 1860s that :

&gt;**Palestine  must  belong  to  the  Jews,  and  Jerusalem  is  destined  to  become  the  seat  of  a  Jewish  Empire.**

[Moses Hess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Hess) (1812 – 1875) was one of the early Zionist thinkers. In his 1862 book “[Rome and Jerusalem: The Last National Question](https://ia902601.us.archive.org/27/items/cu31924012933697/cu31924012933697.pdf)”, Hess advocates for **the colonization of Palestine and the foundation of a Jewish Colonization Association**.

[Leon Pinsker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Pinsker) (1821-1891) was one of the early Zionist activists. In his 1882 Pamphlet “[Auto-Emancipation](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/quot-auto-emancipation-quot-leon-pinsker)”, he was advocating for the creation of a Jewish colony in Palestine as a solution to anti-semitism in Europe :

&gt; **If the experts find in favor of Palestine** or Syria, this decision would not be based on the assumption that the country could be transformed in time by labor and industry into a quite productive one.[...] This change cannot be brought about by the civil emancipation of the Jews in this or that state, but only by the auto-emancipation of the Jewish people as a nation, **the foundation of a colonial community belonging to the Jews, which is some day to become our inalienable home, our country**. 

The three thinkers that I mentioned are often considered to be “proto-Zionists’ who inspired [Theodore Herzl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl) (1860 – 1904), considered to be the founding father of the ideology of political Zionism. 

Theodore Herzl wrote in his 1896 pamphlet “[The Jewish State](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/quot-the-jewish-state-quot-theodor-herzl)"" :

&gt;The Jewish Company is partly modeled on the lines of a great land-acquisition company. It might be called a Jewish Chartered Company, though it cannot exercise sovereign power, and has other than purely **colonial tasks**.

Herzl wrote to the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, and asked for his support for this colonial project :  

&gt;**The undertaking will be made great and promising by the granting of colonial rights**. This is tremendous attraction for the outlawed, enfeebled and unfortunate Jewish people.

(Source : the Complete Diaries of Theodor Herzl, volume 4, p 1336)

He also wrote to Cecil Rhodes, yet another important figure of British colonization, who was responsible for the colonization of South Africa, Rhodesia and many others, during which countless indigenous people were killed and subjugated:

&gt; You are being invited to make history. That cannot frighten you, nor will you laugh at it. It is not in your accustomed line, it doesn't involve Africa, but a piece of Asia Minor, not English, but Jews. [...] How, then, do I happen to turn to you? **Because it is something colonial**.

(Source : the Complete Diaries of Theodor Herzl, volume 3, p 1194)
[Max Nordau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Nordau) (1849 – 1923) was Zionist leader and co-founder of the World Zionist Organization with Theodor Herzl. Like Herzl, he was against “illegal immigration” to Ottoman Palestine and in favor of obtaining the rights to legally colonize Palestine. He wrote in “[Zionism and antisemitism](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/24186/24186-h/24186-h.htm)” in 1905 :
&gt;""Zionism rejects on principle all colonization on a small scale, and the idea of ""sneaking"" into Palestine. **The Zionists have therefore devoted themselves preëminently to a zealous and tireless advocacy of the uniting of the already existing Jewish colonies in Palestine with those who until now have given them their aid and who of late have inclined towards the withdrawal of their support from them**."" 
&gt;**For the moment the committee of action is trying to obtain from Turkey a charter for the colonization of such land in Palestine as can be disposed of**, and which at present is lying waste, and for the opening of its neglected resources.

[Menachem Ussishkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Ussishkin) (1863 – 1941)
 was a Russian-born Zionist leader and head of the Jewish National Fund. He was one of the founders of the “Labour Zionist” faction of Zionism. He was opposed to Herzl during the “Uganda scheme” debates during which Herzl suggested creating a Zionist colony in what is now Kenya. In 1905, he published the pamphlet “[Our Program](https://archive.org/details/ourprogramessay00ussiiala/page/10/mode/2up?q=colonization)”, in which he advocates for purchasing lands, moving to Palestine, creating settlements, and educational and organizational work among the people. Much like Herzl, he was not afraid of describing this undertaking as “colonial”. Chapter 8 of Our Program is called ”The colonization of the country (Palestine) by Jewish Farmers and Artisans”. On page 27 of the same pamphlet, he writes :
&gt;This is the condition of the Labor Problem in Palestine. Among many thousand Arabs there are only a few Jewish laborers. That is in the broadest sense of the word a sore spot in our **colonisation**.

[Ber Borochov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ber_Borochov) (1881 - 1917), one of the founders of the Labor Zionist movement, wrote in 1906 the manifesto of the movement “[Our Platform](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/quot-poalei-tziyon-our-platform-quot-ber-dov-borochov)” in which he writes : 

&gt;Jewish migration must be transformed from immigration into **colonization**. This means a territorial solution of the Jewish problem [..] 

[Nahum Sokolow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahum_Sokolow) (1859 – 17 May 1936) was the Secretary General of the World Zionist Organization between 1907-1909 and its president between 1931-1935. In History of Zionism, volume 1, published in 1919, he writes : 

&gt;**Zionists want a commonwealth of Jewish colonization and labour**, a settlement of Jewish pioneers and workers who will be able to create and to develop a civilization of their own, undisturbed by any restrictions. This is possible only in Palestine, and is the paramount necessity of the whole Jewish people all over the world.

[David Wolffsohn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wolffsohn) (1855 - 1914) was the President of the World Zionist Organization between 1905-1911. [In a June 30th, 1896 letter to Max Nordau](https://archive.org/stream/davidwolffsohnei00robi/davidwolffsohnei00robi_djvu.txt), he writes :

&gt;**Our discussion related only to the newspaper reports and I found everywhere the fear that the founding of a Society of Jews could perhaps harm the colonisation of Palestine**. The previous activities of the German Zionists consisted and still consist of practical support for the colonisation of Palestine. Ten years of painstaking work lie behind us and only today are the colonies beginning to bear fruit.  

[Otto Warburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Warburg) (1859 – 1938) was a botanist and the President of the World Zionist Organization between 1911-1921. After his death in 1938, [an obituary in the Jewish Telegraphic Agency](http://pdfs.jta.org/1938/1938-01-12_135.pdf) described his contribution to the Zionist cause:

&gt;He became interested in Zionism in the early days of the movement, and was one of the heads of the Palestine Commission appointed by the Sixth Zionist Congress. However, **he had little taste for “diplomatic Zionism” and devoted himself largely to “practical Zionism,” or colonization work in Palestine**.

[Franz Oppenheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Oppenheimer) (1864-1943) was a prominent German sociologist, economist and Zionist activist. On 26 August 1903, he gave an address at the sixth Zionist Congress in Basel dubbed “[A First Program for Zionist Colonization](https://www.franz-oppenheimer.de/fo03a.htm)”. In his speech, he argues for Zionist colonization of Palestine through the creation of agricultural settlements for Jews. 


[Vladimir Jabotinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ze%27ev_Jabotinsky) (1880  – 1940), another important Zionist leader who came a generation after Herzl and Ussishkin, wrote in his 1923 essay ""[The Iron Wall](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/quot-the-iron-wall-quot)"" :

&gt;It is utterly impossible to obtain the voluntary consent of the Palestine Arabs for converting ""Palestine"" from an Arab country into a country with a Jewish majority. My readers have a general idea of the history of colonisation in other countries. I suggest that they consider all the precedents with which they are acquainted, and see whether there is one solitary instance of any colonisation being carried on with the consent of the native population. There is no such precedent. **The native populations, civilised or uncivilised, have always stubbornly resisted the colonists**, irrespective of whether they were civilised or savage

[Israel Langwill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Zangwill) (1864 1926) was a close associate of Theodore Herzl. Langwill later rejected the plan to colonize Palestine and called for Jewish colonization elsewhere, since he believed there weren’t enough resources in Palestine to host all 16 million Jews who lived in the world at the time. [During a speech at the Carnegie Hall on October 13th, 1923](http://pdfs.jta.org/1923/1923-10-15_197.pdf), he said : 

&gt;Political Zionism is dead [...] Too late the Carlsbad conference has voted its protest that not even the State lands and waste lands mentioned in the mandate have been allotted to the Zionists. **Indeed, a colonization without a territorial charter, in which the land has to be bought literally by the square yard and every purchase puts up the price of land against yourself, iis a monstrosity unknown to history**.


[Arthur Ruppin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Ruppin) (1876 – 1943), Zionist leader, one of the founders of Tel Aviv, wrote in 1929 in [Buying the Emek (Jezreel Valley)](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/quot-buying-the-emek-jezreel-valley-quot-arthur-ruppin) :

&gt;**The acquisition of the Emek Yizael for Jewish colonization has been the object of Jewish efforts for many years**. It was natural that this region, the largest fertile plain of Palestine, should have aroused the interest of the Jewish colonization societies at the very beginning.

[David Ben Gurion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ben-Gurion) (1886 – 1973) was the head of the Jewish Agency (operative branch of the World Zionist Organization) and later first Prime Minister of Israel. [In a 1937 letter to his son Amos](https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/2013/04/06/the-ben-gurion-letter/), reacting to [the Peel Commission Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peel_Commission), he wrote : 

&gt; **Palestine is grossly under populated. It contains vast colonization potential which the Arabs neither need nor are qualified (because of their lack of need) to exploit**. There is no Arab immigration problem. There is no Arab exile. Arabs are not persecuted. They have a homeland, and it is vast.

[Joseph Weitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Weitz) (1890–1972) was the head of **the Jewish Agency's Colonization Department**, which was tasked with acquiring land for the Zionist enterprise in Palestine, wrote in 1938 :
&gt; “Between ourselves it must be clear that there is no room for both peoples together in this country. We shall not achieve our goal if the Arabs are in this small country. **There is no other way than to transfer the Arabs from here to neighboring countries — all of them. Not one village, not one tribe should be left**.”
(Quoted from [A History of the Concept of ""Transfer"" in Zionism by Israel Shahak ](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2537340))


[Cham Weizmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Weizmann) (1874 – 1952) was a Zionist leader who served as president of the Zionist Organization between 1921–1931 and 1935–1946 and later as the first president of Israel. [During a hearing on 8 July 1947 at 9 AM for the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine (UNSCOP)](https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-183165/), he said : 


&gt;Other peoples have colonized great countries, rich countries. They found when they entered there backward populations. And they did for the backward populations what they did. **I am not a historian, and I am not sitting in judgment on the colonizing activity of the various great nations which have colonized backward regions. But I would like to say that, as compared with  the result of the colonizing activities of other peoples, our impact on  the Arabs has  not  produced very much worse results than what has been produced by others in other countries**.

Zionists founded organizations which they openy called colonial, like **[the Jewish Colonization Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Colonisation_Association)** in 1891 or **[the Jewish Colonial Trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_Leumi)** in 1902 .

I have cited numerous primary sources from all the important Zionist leaders between the 1860s and the 1930s, they all openly said that they were colonizers, because at the time it was seen as something positive, rightfully undertaken by the strong for their own benefit.

Jared Kushner has been described by many people on the American left as an extreme rightist who does whatever Netanyahu tells him to do. While Netanyahu had a lot of influence on the administration, Kushner was not a part of it and in fact in many cases his views were contrary to Netanyahu's. Jared Kushner has been described by many people on the American left as an extreme rightist whose his ideology is very right-wing like Netanyahu. 

In many cases his views were contrary to Netanyahu's and he knew how to put Netanyahu in his place. Kushner was a classical Centrist. He was not a hawkish right-wing supporter of settlements who believes in Israeli control over Judea and Samaria like Netanyahu, Ron Dermer and David Friedman. On the other hand, he was not a leftist idealist, not shocked by the ""occupation"" like Martin Indik, and did not see the Palestinians at the checkpoints as an incarnation of Rosa Parks on a bus in Alabama as Barack Obama. Liberal in a Republican administration. A conservative in a democratic administration. 

Despite his contempt for the settlers, he despised the Palestinian narrative and had no tolerance and openness to discussions about history. He rolled his eyes at the Palestinian demands for ""justice"". He despised the misery of the refuge-ism and the ""Nakba"". 

His alienation towards the emotional aspects of the conflict on the Palestinian side were noticeable and he preferred to focus on the future and not to be drawn into Palestinian lamentation over the past.

Despite the good and professional work between the parties, there were two camps on the issue of Israel: the Netanyahu-Dermer-Friedman axis which received support from the evangelical lobby and later also Mike Pompeo, who were more hawkish, supporters of settlements and Israeli sovereignty over the territories. On the other hand, Kushner's more pragmatic camp, was aided by people like Avi Berkowitz. 

The book describes how Netanyahu, Friedman, and Dermer ""stretched the rope"" too much until Kushner had to put them through an ""educational series"" and twist their arms in order to put them back in line. Kushner was a staunch supporter of Israel and was in an excellent relationship with Netanyahu and Dermer, but his positions were much more centrist rather than the Ideological right-wing direction of Pompeo, Friedman, and Bibi. 

&gt;Alongside Ambassador Friedman, he found Netanyahu nervous. A former White House official told me that the meeting was not good and Netanyahu talked to Berkowitz rudely and with contemptuously   
\---

&gt;Dermer threatned to leak to the media the secret understandings that allegedly existed between the parties regarding the annexation, but they were not published when the peace plan was presented. Trump's advisers warned of the serious consequences of such a move

\-----

When we advanced in this, of course, it is impossible to shift the blame from the Palestinians. The Palestinians did not understand that a new ""landlord"" had arrived in the neighborhood and continued to insist and not understand their place. In other words they were sure they were the center of the world. And treated as if they were above the Americans and as if everyone had to conform to their demands.

The Palestinians refused to even discuss with the administration after the administration recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, which is recognizing reality. 

Abu Mazen and Erekat thought that the boycott on the White House will cause Trump to abandon his efforts to formulate a plan to end The Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They were wrong big time. Kushner and his team continued to work on the plan, but the Palestinians lost the ability to influence its components. 

The Palestinians got used to the Obama administration who were committed to historical justice towards them and the international community, they had difficulty accepting the ""electric shock""

The Palestinians continued to look to the past and make unrealistic demands for ""historical justice"", Jerusalem, lines 67 and the right of return - and simply refused to get on the train of the new reality. This actually highlights the problem that many people have been talking about in the Palestinian National Movement. This even led to a situation where they were not invited to the economic conference in Bahrain.

&gt;Kushner pulled out a list of contentious issues and asked each one how he sees the solution to each. The answers of Molho and Erekat were similar. They took him to the Balfour Declaration of 1917, the Partition Plan of 1947, and the 1967 War. ""I don't want a history lesson, let's talk about the present,"" Kushner told them.

Although I am not Jewish or Palestinian, I empathize with the lives lost on October 7th and understand how shocking and heartbreaking that day was for many families. I understand there are hostages that still need to be set free in Palestine and how nerve wracking it is for those families as well.

I am no expert on war or history, and believe I still have a lot to learn in life. I’m just a 19 year old girl that’s not affected at all and is a bystander to what’s happening in a completely different country. 

The devastation and destruction gets more apparent with every day in Gaza, and just reading about how people were shot trying to get food and aid breaks my heart. If Israel is fighting to release the hostages, why are so many civilians dying in the process? If Hamas does not care how many civilian casualties occur, why is that the current course of action?  Maybe I’m wrong and have this situation mixed up, and I know a world with complete world peace is basically impossible, but I’m trying to understand and educate myself on both sides to understand the normal people that live in both Gaza and Israel.

We all saw what happened after 9/11 with Afghanistan and Iraq. We all know, that minerals and oil are the fuel keeping the war-machine on going in the middle east. Denying that is a delusion of the highest order.
So stop pretending there is a moral cause behind the current conflict, when it is actually a trillion dollar business-opportunity dictating the current geopolitical events, with utter moral bankruptcy.


Every dead Palestinian child and every raped women in Kibbutz. Do you want to know their worth? 1 Trillion cubic feet of  natural gas in the Gaza-Marine, which are as the result of the Oslo Accords under Palestinian jurisdiction.


What i see is an Israeli government that gave on 18 June 2023, the preliminary approval for the development of the Gaza Marine Project, with some inconvenient risks to deal with: Gaza-Marine being under jurisdiction of Palestinian authorities and Hamas in Gaza, which can easily become a  problem for this trillion dollar project.


Well, solving that problem seems to be pretty obvious. Getting rid of Gaza with possible acting capacities on theb Gaza-Marine and restrict the capacities to act from the West Bank. Once that is done, who is going to stop Israel from developing the Gaza-Marine Project in its own pace? 


Given how Netanyahu supports Ben Gvir with Otzma Jehudit at the West Bank with radical settler violence, it is more than safe to assume, this regime intends to do anything to keep an established Palestinian State from claiming their rightfully owned minerals. Even working with Hamas -  Smotrich said Hamas would be a asset for Israel on television/ Netanyahu financed Hamas 2019.


I see a government that had over a year all the intelligence and Battle Plans of Oct7 and didn't think to take them seriously. They even got a warning on Oct6 and gave it no relevance - using instead their IDF units for settler violence at the West Bank, not even warning the organiser of the Nova Festival.


And now? 


After Oct7 i see a very convenient atrocity to justify an annexation of Gaza, with the blind support of USA and Europe - which all conveniently use ""the eradication of Hamas"" as a straw man argument, to get their hands on 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Seems to me like the best upcoming circumstances, to get the highest profit out of the Gaza-Marine Project without sharing anything with Palestinian Authorities.


This wouldn't be the first rodeo for the US, using a straw man argument for oil and given the fact that Russia isn't on good terms with Europe -  with gas/oil prices going through the roof - it explains pretty well how blind some European states support the Israeli cause.

After a year of bombardment from Hezbollah, triggered by Hamas' massacre of Israelis on the 7th of October, Israel is fighting back in Lebanon.

So far, over 250 Israeli hostages were taken, and over 1700 Israelis dead, the majority civilian. More than 20 thousand rockets have been fired at Israel from Gaza, Lebanon, Iraq, Iran, and Yemen.

Last night, Israel took out the leader of the largest terror organization (or call it ""non-state military"" if you find ""terror"" to be a loaded term). This follows successful strikes against a large amount of Hezbollah leadership, and an audacious operation that culminated in the explosion of thousands of pagers and walkie talkies held by Hezbollah operatives.

1mt68qf,IsraelPalestine,"Calls for Hamas to surrender Posted by Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib on X yesterday.

The Foreign Minister of the Palestinian Authority, Varsen Aghabekian, an Armenian Christian, issued a statement calling for Hamas to disarm/surrender its weapons and end the disaster that the terror group started with its Oct. 7 massacre. Soon after, hordes of Hamas heads and activists, including Huthaifa Azzam, the Jihadi Hamas supporter and son of the infamous Palestinian terrorist and al-Qaeda founder, Abdullah Yusuf Azzam, started attacking Varsen for her name, character, and accusing her of not being an Arab, Muslim, or a “real” Palestinian. This, unfortunately, is demonstrative of the Muslim Brotherhood-led terror army that proliferates throughout the Arab world, and those supporters of Hamas who always proclaim to be the vanguards of an incoming Islamic Caliphate that far surpasses a Palestinian State.

Unfortunately, large numbers of idiotic and ill-informed Western activists and supposed journalists still think that Hamas is somehow interested in a Palestinian State as part of a two-state solution or that the terror group and its ideological underpinning allow for anything other than Muslim, Arab supremacy that dominates and suppresses all other ethnic and religious groups. A Hamas victory of any kind would produce scenes that are identical to what we have witnessed in recent months in Syria’s Southern Druze province of As Suwayda or coastal areas populated by Alawites.

The good news is that there are numerous Palestinians who stood up to the son of al-Qaeda’s founder and his ilk, clarifying that Palestinian identity is indeed a diverse one in which Christians and Armenians are founding members of its social fabric.

The bad and horrendous news is that a global army of feminists, queers, leftists, and multi-racial and ethnic activists is clearly and explicitly supportive of Hamas and the so-called “resistance” narrative. These imbeciles haven’t the slightest clue of their role as ‘useful idiots’ to Islamist terrorists like Hamas Salafis, Iranian-sponsored partisans, and global Jihadis who would have no problem using and abusing ill-informed fools to achieve their goals, only to turn against them when the time is right and place them in Islamist-style Gulags",,

1d6gpwb,IsraelPalestine,"Pro-Palestinians: will you accept a permanent ceasefire if it means an end to Hamas' rule in Gaza? The ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine has been marked by numerous ceasefires and resumptions of hostilities over decades. One of the most contentious aspects of this conflict is the role of Hamas, a group that has governed Gaza since 2007 and is designated as a terrorist organization by many countries. The question of whether a permanent ceasefire, contingent on the end of Hamas' rule and military capabilities, would be acceptable is not insignificant.

A permanent ceasefire could significantly reduce the violence and loss of life on both sides. For many, inclusing various pro-Palestinians, the immediate cessation of hostilities is a critical humanitarian goal. Moreover, without Hamas' military control, Gaza might experience improved living conditions through increased international aid and infrastructure development. Economic opportunities could flourish without the constant threat of military action.

It is also true that many international actors are unwilling to engage with Hamas. A new, less controversial leadership might attract more diplomatic and economic support from the global community. Ending Hamas' rule might open the door for renewed peace negotiations. With a less militant leadership, there could be more room for diplomatic solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

A troubling aspect of this debate is the perception that some pro-Palestinians might be willing to sacrifice Palestinian lives to preserve Hamas' power. This viewpoint can appear hypocritical, especially when the stated goal is to protect and improve the lives of Palestinians. If maintaining Hamas' military capabilities leads to continued conflict and suffering, then prioritizing the group's power over the well-being of civilians seems contradictory. Advocating for the continuation of hostilities while condemning the loss of life highlights a stark inconsistency in the logic of some proponents. The ultimate aim should be the safety, dignity, and prosperity of the Palestinian people, which might be more achievable under a governance structure that prioritizes peace and development over armed struggle.

So, would you accept a permanent ceasefire if it means an end to Hamas' rule in Gaza? This means an end to their military capabilities as well.

It’s nothing but lifelong PTSD looking over your shoulder and wondering when you will be taken. No matter if the treatment is “fair” or if when being returned you’re told to “keep waving,” becoming a hostage means you may never see your home, friends, or family again. If you do see them again, now the worry becomes *when* and not *if* it will happen again. 

It’s disgusting to see videos being released and the display of hostages notably telling their stories of, “we were treated so well…” Stop. They were taken without consent and without knowledge of a safe return. 

No matter which end you see this from, understand that being a hostage is a life changing experience and pointing at anything and comparing treatments is ridiculous and reductive to the safety of those it impacts.

Edit: Stop and think if released hostages said things in a positive light that they may have a knife to the back or gun to the head ready to take them out. They were found and abducted once, it very well can happen again if they say anything against their captives.

I have a good understanding of the conflict and history as well as being well versed on Jewish Law and religion. (Also have decent knowledge on Islam having studied it for awhile)

As a whole i’m just interested to see other people’s views and share mine to people who may have not received that same information due to lack of access or just not knowing these type of people.

there is a lot more where it's coming from so don't worry.

but regarding the israeli palestine issue and why the UN as a body is worthless, besides being worthless they have also picked a side so they can't be used as a non biased source, here are some key facts for those who still pretend the UN is some kind of ""peace keeping"" body

UNRWA was founded in 1949, long before the so called ""israeli occupation""(1967) that the moderate pro ""Palestinians"" claim is the sole reason for the conflict:

UNRWA is an organization whose purpose is to prolong the Palestine conflict until it's resolved in the desired way(israel is destroyed)

I'm not talking about recent stuff regarding co-operation with hamas 

https://www.unrwa.org/newsroom/press-releases/unrwa-condemns-placement-rockets-second-time-one-its-schools

I'm talking about it's inherent purpose for existing, the UN has 2 agencies for refugees, one for the Palestinians(UNRWA) and one for the rest of the world(UNHCR)

UNHCR:

The primary purpose is to safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees globally. 
UNHCR works with refugees, asylum-seekers, and internally displaced people, regardless of their origin, aiming to ensure they can exercise their right to seek asylum and find safe refuge. 

UNHCR determines that a person is no longer a refugee through a process called cessation of refugee status, based on Article 1C of the 1951 Refugee Convention. This happens when international protection is no longer necessary or justified due to changes in the refugee’s circumstances or in their country of origin

UNRWA: 

Operates within the specified geographic areas, providing direct services to Palestinian refugees. 
Areas of Operation:
Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank (including East Jerusalem), and the Gaza Strip. 

Defines and registers Palestine refugees based on a unique mandate:

Those who lived in Palestine between June 1946 and May 1948 and lost homes/livelihood due to the 1948 conflict.

- Hereditary refugee status: Descendants of male Palestine refugees can inherit refugee status, even generations later, which prolongs the conflict for eternity and increase the number of refugees regardless of their conditions(yes, even Palestinian billionaires are refugees) until they can return to ""their"" lands of before the 1967 borders, which means displacing Israelis 

so we can clearly see the UN goal of creating UNRWA.

there is another key factor which blatantly shows the UN hateful agenda against israel- their support for the PLO.

the PLO was founded in 1964, also before the so called ""occupation"", and obviously they started attacking israel instead of trying to gain independence under the rule of egypt and jordan(and it's not like ""Palestinians"" haven't attacked israel before 1964)

the PLO goals are the destruction of Israel:

The original PLO Charter (Palestinian National Covenant), particularly the 1968 version, called for the destruction of Israel and rejected its legitimacy.

What the Charter Said:
- Article 9: Declared that armed struggle is the only way to liberate Palestine, making it the overall strategy.
- Article 15: Called for the elimination of Zionism in Palestine, which many interpret as a euphemism for dismantling the State of Israel.
- Article 19: Stated that the establishment of Israel is entirely illegal, regardless of time passed.
- Article 22: Described Zionism as a racist, imperialist, fascist movement and Israel as its instrument.

Attempts to Amend the Charter:
- In 1996, the Palestinian National Council voted to amend the Charter to remove clauses inconsistent with the Oslo Accords, which included recognizing Israel.
- However, the vote did not meet the required two-thirds majority to formally amend the Charter under its own rules.
- In 1998, Yasser Arafat held a symbolic assembly with President Clinton present, where participants raised hands to support a letter claiming the offensive articles were nullified—but no formal legal amendment was made.

The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) has not been formally condemned by the United Nations in a direct resolution. In fact, the UN has historically recognized and engaged with the PLO in several significant ways:

key UN revolutions regarding the PLO

1. Resolution 3210 (1974) – Invited the PLO to participate in General Assembly discussions on the question of Palestine.  
2. Resolution 3236 (1974) – Affirmed the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including self-determination and the right of return.  
3. Resolution 3237 (1974) – Granted the PLO observer status at the United Nations.  
4. Resolution 3375 (1975) – Called for the PLO to participate in peace efforts in the Middle East.  
5. Resolution 43/177 (1988) – Acknowledged the proclamation of the State of Palestine and changed the designation from “PLO” to “Palestine” in the UN system.  
6. Resolution 67/19 (2012) – Upgraded Palestine’s status to a non-member observer state, reaffirming the PLO’s role as its representative.

Have you not seen already the negative effects of wanting a one-state solution? Only disasters and more chaos. Look at 1948 war, it was a chaos all because of the dream of one-state solution. now this is for Israelis: just look at the consequence on pushing for one-state solution after Oct7, didn't turned out well, no? Global oppositions. And those from Gaza and Westbank, have you not seen already the negative effect for one-state solution? The IDF responds it with violence by displacing you, so instead of opting for two-states solution you allow them to seize more lands and get the most out of you. The more you fight Israel, the further chances for a Palestinian country will be, the more Israel pushes for a one-state solution you too will get oppositions from Hamas and PIJ.

Let's admit, the one-state solution is a myth and legend much like Marvel stories and ancient Greek myths, it's not feasible for a lasting peace.

If two-states solution is implemented, then the Palestinian Government can close the costumes and border control at any time and they can let anyone in at will, so without a two-states solution only chaos will be. What do you choose: chaos or lasting peace? If you let the Jews have a state, neither them will have any reason to attack the State of Palestine. So, let's make a compromise instead. If you opt for a two-states solution, nobody will displace you and you'll have sovereignty over the villages, towns and cities. Look at Pakistan and India, they hardly attack one another, look at KSA and UK, hardly they attack one another, why? Because they mind their own business, why can't you do the same?

These are several groups which have extensive histories of antisemitism. Christianity has a history of persecution of Jewish people that is over a thousand years long. The UK banned Jewish people from being there beginning in 1290 and it lasted for 350 years. The United States has a history of antisemitism with the KKK, Henry Ford, and the ban on Jewish immigration in the era leading up to WWII. Based on history, you'd think that Zionism would have tenuous support from these groups (US + UK empires, Christian nationalists, and the far right) or that the support would not be trustworthy. What about the Christian myth that Jewish people killed Jesus? Nazism was based on the support in Germany of Protestant Evangelicals in the 1930s, which is the same group in the United States that has given significant support to Zionism. Europe has produced many laws discriminating against Jewish people throughout history. Here is a quote from Wikipedia: ""Christians imposed ever-increasing anti-Jewish measures over the ensuing centuries, including acts of ostracism, humiliation, expropriation, violence, and murder—measures which culminated in the Holocaust."" There are millions more, perhaps even double, the number of Christian Zionists in the world than Jewish Zionists. Part of the Christian support for Zionism involves fulfilling a biblical prophecy with the ""Second Coming of Jesus Christ,"" the end of the world, and conversion by Jews to Christianity. This idea of evangelizing Jewish people who returned to Israel originated with Puritans in England in the 1500s. This reminds me of the prejudiced ""Back to Africa"" movement with the American Colonization Society in the 1800s in the United States, which was an attempt to maintain white supremacy in America through deportations. How can someone balance support for Zionism with the motives of Britain, America, Christianity and the far-right that have historically been opposed to Jewish civil rights? What right does anyone have to Jerusalem, as it has been invaded 44 different times throughout its existence as part of civilization? Doesn't this idea of territorial claims to a holy land by a group of people just seem like another version of the Crusades?",,

1buaipa,IsraelPalestine,"Dear Sinwar I don't have enough time before this post is reported by so ignorant teenager for god knows what reason, so let's make this as quick as possible.  


  
You are a demon.

  
Now you might be asking yourself, ""Why am I a demon? I have brought nothing but justice for my people.""  
Well here is the thing. You didn't.  


  
What you call your ""organization of freedom fighters"" is a gang of brain-dead terrorists who follow your every command.  


  
""But half of the internet disagrees. what proof do you have to tell otherwise?""  
Well, it's all thanks to the sweet art of PROPAGANDA.  


  
In simpler terms, I'm gonna explain the 3 steps of terrorist propaganda.  


  
NUMBER 1. Life needs to suck.  


Take a GOOD look at your country and a GOOD look at mine.  
In Israel, everything is okay. Good ol' sustainable economy and high education.  
Whereas you live in a dump (no offense).  
Your strip country is barely supported by Eygpt, and it shows. You are separated by the Symian mountains, for god's sake. and you barely have any houses to sleep in.  
this country is in desperate need of economic help.  
Now in this scenario, some kind of donation would give you food to help you, and make you a little happier.  
But YOU saw an opportunity for power. you knew how to persuade people, you knew you had a talent.  


  
This leads us to NUMBER 2. THE PROPAGANDA.  


  
You used the people's anger and instability in life as a way to target us. The people of Israel.  
The same people who reportedly gave you a life-saving surgery for your brain tumor while you were serving your prison sentence.  
We saved your life there, but you didn't care whether or not we saved your A@%#, you just hate that you were sent to prison. TWICE.  


  
But here we are! In NUMBER 3. TERROR  


  
Your so-called freedom fighters have kidnapped, killed, burned, and raped our boys, girls, men, women, and dogs. You can't make this up. you have body cam proof on the internet. But oh no, people just call it fake.  
And now you might be asking us ""Well, if you are such a goody two shoes, how come you have a border around the Gaza Strip? why were you keeping us out?""  
Well pal, when you live in a small country, like 22,000 sq. km, surrounded by its biggest enemies and haters, you gotta afford some protection.  
And your main economic supporter Egypt has a really deep history of beef between us.  
But you managed to hide all these facts with NUMBER 4. MORE PROPAGANDA.  


  
Since the beginning of the war between Ukraine and Russia, and all the brainwashing and whatnot, you had the entire world comparing us to them without saying a thing about it.  
YOU being Ukraine, the helpless victim of Israel, being Russia, the big bad.  
Well, sometimes power doesn't always equal evilness.  
some people wanted to do good with it.  
Greta Tornberg, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, James Donaldson, Barack Obama, etc...  
But you and all the other people just assumed that every person who has some form of diplomatic or technological superiority over others is going to use it for bad.  


  
Besides, don't take advantage of other people's property like you do.  
And if you don't think I can prove it then let me give you a hint.  
Half of the world has reportedly given you more than 300 Million dollars to use for medicine and food supplies. You got that money from donations, and you're still getting them.  
On the 2nd of March this year Joe Biden reportedly sent food supplies to the people of the Gaza Strip. If you pay attention to the video, you realize that they are fighting like goddamn animals.  


  
Now considering the donation for the Gaza people was established in 2023, that begs the question: if they were so hungry, and the donation is worth 300 million dollars, what happened to the money that was meant for medical supplies and food?  
there should be camps with supplies and doctors.  
In short: Where does the money go?  
you don't just leave a big pile of cash on the ground to rot in the sun. something must have happened to it.  
And I couldn't help but notice that you recently have earned a fortune ever since the war.  
Money doesn't grow on trees, buddy.  
And the only two things I know who either want or need that kind of money are you and your clan.  
You stole that money from your people for both your army's weaponry and your personal gain. That same money was meant to save the people of Gaza.  
And let me remind you that that same money is supposed to be used for protection as well. You know... shelters?  
No wonder more Palestinians die in Gaza than Jews die in Israel. You are barely doing anything to save the people you say you are protecting.  


  
Finally, here's the funny part.  
You wanna know how I found all of this evidence?  
THE INTERNET.  
I know, the internet doesn't seem like a valuable resource of diplomatic and terroristic evidence, but that is because people use it the wrong way.  
What I did was look at BOTH  sides of the conflict.  
That's right, I looked at videos and posts that support Israel AND Palestine.  
I listened, learned, and overall just tried to understand both sides.  
   
And guess what? I did.  
And it turns out that if you simplify the conflict, it's a philosophical question:  
Person 1 (the Jews) lives in an apartment.  
Everyone has an apartment.  
One day he got kicked out of the apartment.  
Then person 2 (the Muslims) took the apartment.  
Later, person 1 got his apartment back.  
So the question is, whose apartment is it now?  
That is the question that we were trying to answer. And the thing about philosophy is that it's not easily solvable.  
And you didn't try to solve the question. You have tried to change it.  


  
Now look where your bullcrap got us. Meaningless violence not only in the holy land but all over the world.  
Two opposite protests clash against each other in every country.  
Social media apps taking advantage of the situation by spreading horrifying lies.  
Celebrities destroying their reputations by publicly supporting a side.  
All of that is happening because of that one tiny piece of bible driven dirt you can barely see on the global map.  
And it's all because of you.  


  
You took advantage of Palestinians' lives, spread lies about the Jews, ruined people's careers, and maybe even ruined lives  
Now why am I typing all of this? What's the point of writing this letter if there is certainly no chance you will ever read it?  
And my answer is that we can all learn something from this...  
So the moral of the story is to protest normally!  


  
Gather a large community of people who aren't given any attention. Show them to the world. Show how important they are to the world.  
Black Lives Matter is a good example of a proper protest. groups of people flooding the street, and that's it. They don't need guns and tunnels to prove a point. They just need to spread the word wide enough for all of us to hear.  
We didn't invent debates for it to be decorative, we used it as a tool.  


  
Share your opinions. Listen to others! Don't think that you are always right! Respect other's opinions.  
This is what this subreddit was built for! To avoid any toxic interactions online and encourage civil debates.  
And we will treat it as such.  


  
And as for you, Sinwar, I hope you will come to terms with what you have done and how it all could have been avoided.

But on the other hand, Trump administration's ""to turn Gaza into a holiday resort"" seems very distastefully unethical (people literally died there and you build this over the rubbles of their houses?) and what's going on seems like an ethnic cleansing.

I know you guys don't like Turkish opposition due to them being secular and europe-leaning, but they recently called for a protest for Palestine with the slogan and intention of ""stop the relocation"" amongst anti-government protests, taking the energy from what's been going on.

so i dont understand how people can call it a genocide when the killing isn’t about who they are, but about them trying to take over the land.

18bpe8h,IsraelPalestine,"Its about time that the Pro-Israel Liberal crowd retire the 2S solution This narrative presents a false or outdated idea that Israel is regrettably occupying the West Bank that was forced upon it. And that it contains a few Jewish “settlements” here and there that can either be either repatriated or annexed through land swaps to create Palestine. And that the only obstacle are the stubborn, aggressive and unreliable Palestinian political elites who keep refusing generous peace plans like the recent Trump deal.

The real facts on the ground is that there are around 800,000 Jewish settlers in East Jerusalem and the West Bank/Jordan valley scattered across the entire occupied territories in the form of from Israeli only large 100k cities all the way to small towns with Universities, highways and an American subsidies occupation army with military bases and checkpoints that choke every Palestinian populate city/village. As by design they were built strategically to create over 20+ Palestinian populated cantons and to ensure the best land, hills and water resources for a potential annexation. In other words, a 2S solution is a basic legalization of the status quo, where Israel takes the Jordan valley and most of settlements along with humiliating security zones (aka checkpoints) that cages every populated Palestinian city.

While only 7-10% of the total population of Israel, this Jewish fundie population is ideologically united on a god mission and dominates the entire Israeli political scene either through strategic votes, bullying or coercion.

A previous evacuation due to American/international and IDF security pressure of only 6800 settlers in Gush Katif of Gaza almost led to a civil war. And it required an average compensation of $450,000 for every family to quiet things down. I won’t do a hypothetical calculation for the West Bank because it obviously will be something unimaginable.

Seems like the 2S solution is just being kept alive so that Israel can gaslight or virtue signal the world that they are the nice guys because they know most Americans are too stupid to actually look up settlement activity online or go visit. It also helps obscure the apartheid reality as they can claim its just a temporary military occupation in compliance with international law.

Why don't Pro-Israel liberals start working on merging biblical Jewish settler arguments to supersede the international law consensus on occupation. It will help put down clear human rights and anti-occupation arguments that the Pro-Palestine crowd trashes at Israel. The entire MAGA Christian evangelical party in America is already pioneering this with the Jesus/Armageddon thingy, and the Democratic party will come around, they also do for Israel.",,

1kg83xu,IsraelPalestine,"Just banned from two Anti-Israel Subs for pointing out obvious lies in propaganda videos So I was just banned from two subs “r/NewsHub” and “r/WorldNewsHeadlines” without explanation (and at exactly the same time) for pointing out obvious errors in their Anti-Israel propaganda videos.

Despite the name of the subs, they are completely full of posts that are short clips with not enough even understand what is going on (you have to dig up the original videos) with a sensational headline that is Anti-Israel and is claiming something completely out of context or has absolutely nothing to do with what is happening in the video.

What I commented:

There was a video of a woman in Thailand making a scene at a restaurant arguing with other people at the restaurant. She says something along the lines that it’s her money that gives money to the country. Headline calls her Israeli (which she seemed to me she wasn’t, I thought she was Eastern European; see update to post below) and makes up a whole backstory to the conversation without showing it. This led, of course, to a ton of hate comments against Israel because of this fabricated caption.

There was a video of an Israeli military operation in which a drone was flown into a specific room in a building for a precision strike. The caption said it was a strike against a civilian family targeted by Israel in a residential building. I pointed out that it made no sense for Israel to perform a precision attack if they were targeting civilians - it’s much easier and cheaper to fire mortars and artillery into the building than the cost and expertise required for this operation. It was obviously a precision attack against militants with extra effort to being a precision attack to limit the possibility of civilian casualties.

There was another video of a building on the outskirts of a town in which IDF was engaging. The town was clearly devoid of civilians and this was clearly a combat zone. The caption claimed that Israel was clearing the town of buildings. I asked if that was true, why was there no rubble from razed buildings in the land in front of the building that was being engaged. It was completely open land.

And another video that they were claiming the people in the video were doing something in Israel (I don’t recall what and I can’t access it to refresh my memory), but they were clearly Hasidic people in Brooklyn in the video and there was even an NYPD police officer in the video “escorting” a masked individual away. 

What puzzles me is the amount of obvious BS that is posted which is clearly false information and propaganda and people will rally behind it with antisemitic remarks no matter how clearly it is propaganda or without any context in the videos to validate the claims of the poster. Is the need to hate Jews really this strong? And why are subreddits that are so clearly antisemitic and spreading false propaganda allowed to exist on Reddit???

EDIT: I was incorrect when I stated in my comment that I didn’t believe the woman was Israeli and that she sounded Eastern European to me. Someone did comment with an article of the whole story, though the point of the article was how the clip was taken out of context.

This is still not a reason to ban an account because I say that she sounded Eastern European, not Israeli.

I want to add one more example to this post:

There was an outrageous claim that Jews call for the genocide of Palestinians, but Palestinians never  call for the extermination Jews. EVERYONE STARTED AGREEING WITH THIS NONSENSE 

I responded with a clip of Gazans waving swastika and Hamas flags saying they needed to finish what Hitler started of killing the Jews and turning their bodies into soap (that’s literally what they said in the video I shared).

1cwlcqj,IsraelPalestine,"Why is there so much division in the Israel-Palestine conflict?  All over the Internet and in real life, I see so much division where people radically side with one group or another. From the surface, it looks like there are only two groups: Anti-Israel and Anti-Palestine. When you dig further, the Anti-Israel side is fundamentally Anti-Zionist/Colonialist, and the Anti-Palestine side is Anti-Hamas. Both sides comes to the same conclusion however, that, ""the (other) is committing mass genocide and they should be held accountable for their actions""... Or something more or less harsh and modest. My question is, as a supporter of Anti-Colonialism and Anti-Imperialism, how can one simply discount all of Hamas or Palestinians as Anti-Semitic, when I feel like their real qualm is an invasive group of people have been, and are continuing to reduce the Palestinian land to rubble and it's population to 0 from the beginning of the conflict. The way I see it is like this: if someone knocks on your door once asking to come in and take over your home and you say no, then they come in, the correct response is violence. Now if the invaders have innocent children or other innocents with them that are dragged along in the politicking, then there should be a great measure to not deliberately attack the innocents. I feel like there are travesties and abominations committed by both sides, but I also feel like there is also the original victim (Palestine) and an initial aggravator or aggressor (Israel).

18w7fev,IsraelPalestine,"NYTimes reader’s response to “I am Gaza City’s Mayor, our Lives and Culture are in Rubble”: Letters Several days ago, the New York Times  published an opinion piece by the Mayor of Gaza City [1], who lamented the death of his son and destruction of “intricately designed Rashad al-Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City, named after one of Gaza’s greatest public figures, and its theater, grand hall, public library, printing press and cultural salon” and other treasured places (like a zoo, who knew, that in retrospect seem quite out of place in claimed “open air prison” of Zionist occupation and oppression, but I digress).

The letter prompted several responses [2] including a cringe response of a Holocaust survivor’s son who doesn’t seem to have grasped the lesson.

Anyway, this letter wins hands down and says what I’ve been shouting at the television for weeks every time a Gazan civilian starts with their victim crying with reporters pitching softball appeals for tales of woe and no hard questions:




**To the Editor:**

**Re “I Am Gaza City’s Mayor. Our Lives and Culture Are in Rubble,” by Yahya R. Sarraj (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, Dec. 24):**

**Mr. Sarraj, I feel sad reading your piece. I’m particularly mourning the loss of your eldest son and the destruction of those parts of Gaza that have inspired you throughout your life. These terrible events are caused by war.**

**The people of Gaza celebrated the beginning of this war. Did they not know what would follow? And did you also not know?**

**And did you not know that Hamas’s stated goal is to destroy the state of Israel? And did you not know that if Hamas acted on this goal it would bring war on Gaza?**

**And yet in spite of knowing all this, you mention none of it in your article. Instead you suggest that Palestinians want to live in peace with their neighbors. But three quarters of Palestinians favored the Hamas invasion of Israel. Is this your idea of peace?**

**Did you not know that Hamas has built hundreds of miles of tunnels under your homes, hospitals and schools? And yet you wonder why Israel is bombing them.**

**If you are interested in peace, don’t you think a good starting place would be an honest description of what has happened between Israel and Gaza and not to pretend that Gaza is an innocent victim of indiscriminate military aggression?**

1eyh3av,IsraelPalestine,"Please remove the 1500 character threshold For context, you cannot post on this sub unless you write at least 1500 characters.



Here are my MANY issues with this policy:

1. I learn by asking short questions. The sub says that in theory these can be under 1500 characters. In practice you simply cannot post without reaching the 1500 characters threshold since your post is automatically removed. It doesn’t matter what flair is used, the post gets removed. I don’t want to have to personally contact the mods every time I want to ask a question. This is silly.
2. It does not encourage fully informed, well crafted posts, as is the stated goal. What is encourages is people posting their opinionated stream of consciousness instead of getting to their point in a streamlined manner. 
3. Because of (2), it does not encourage discussion whatsoever. I’m generally pro-Palestine (although the distinctions are a bit arbitrary). I am on this sub because I genuinely want to be better informed about the pro-Israeli perspective and challenge my own views. This is made unbelievably difficult by having to read through five million veiled insults before someone makes a point. A pro-Israeli post from yesterday literally starts with “The selective outrage is truly absurd”. That person’s opinion could have been expressed in significantly less than 1500 words. I could say the same thing about 90% of the posts on this sub.
4. Reading through long posts takes significant cognitive load. By the time I finish reading someone’s opinion or (mostly rethorical) question my patience already runs thin (especially because of point 3). How can you then expect people to engage in calm, patient, open minded discussions in the comments? It’s already an unbelievably taxing topic to discuss. Why make it worse by forcing people to read long essays before they can engage in a discussion.

I decided not to answer them and will not enter in social media fights, but for future reference in case I need it in the future but mostly for myself, I would like to ask here a few questions so that I can be more informed and learn more. Even though it’s obvious I am already biased.

What I do know is that October 7 atrocities should never be justified, that the current Israel land was considered the Jewish ancestral land and Jewish people came back after the holocaust peacefully accepting a UN's partition plan that the other side never accepted, and that Israel left Gaza occupation in 2005 just prior to them electing Hamas.
  
Please feel free to answer as much or as little as you want/can - I will be very grateful!

Questions:

*1. one said that the far right government is currently justifying a genocide with the excuse of fighting a terrorist group that they themselves have created following the ongoing destruction of Palestinian people since the 20 century. Similarly, another person also said that October 7 was caused due to 80 years of occupation.*

--&gt; how would you answer these comments that seem to imply that Hamas and their atrocities have naturally been created due to Israel occupation/violence, as if it was all Israel's fault? 

*2. one said that his Arab friends have been violently impacted by the occupation since the 80s, so he feels strongly for the Palestinian people.*

--&gt; similar as above. What do people mean with the occupation... is it simply Jewish people living in their land?

*3. As mentioned I understand that Israel left Gaza occupation in 2005. Why were they occupying Gaza and what consequences this had in the Palestinian people's life?*

*Why did the leave Gaza - was it to try to aim for peace?* 

*3.1. What about the West Bank - is it still ""occupied"" and what is the situation there? How is this affecting Palestinian people's life?*

*4. Could anyone explain to me why Israel was considered the Jewish people's ancestral land?*

*And why/when did they leave so that they had to return after the holocaust?*

*5. Could anyone also explain what was the situation there BEFORE the second world war...?*

*6. Can anyone explain to me what really happened during the Nakba - did Palestinians get kicked out from their existing houses?*",,

1. Why is this fight given a religious angle always when it is purely or at least largely a political problem of someone illegally occupying land and oppressing the indigenous people and subjecting them to utter humiliation ?
2. Its always claimed: Well its war, and this destruction is normal. How is this even a war with such disparity between the sides ? Also, tell me which war has caused so much destruction and loss of life per sq.km. 
3. Discredit all the figures saying they come from Hamas. Even when nearly all international organizations have come to the same estimates. 
4. The relentless firing on starving and defenseless people at so called Aid centers which the UN has rightly termed as 'Death traps'. This is beyond evil. Regardless of your goals, objectives, people arriving at those centers have nothing, absolutely nothing. Still no uproar ?
5. No distinction is made between Hamas, a terror organization and the Civilians of Gaza. Collective punishment is therefore assumed appropriate and fitting. Why ? Just think how ruthless it is to drive people out of their homes, again and again and again, denying food, water, shelter, and razing 60-70% of a landmass with bombs. And yet there is absolutely no pity for these people. Why ? 
6. Isnt the Israeli society which claims to have a moral high ground always, equally radical as are the  Palestinians ? 
7. Would you bulldoze your neighbors house if it had a rat infestation annoying you ? Then how can you explain mindless killing of women and children simply calling them as 'war collateral' ?
8. Do you agree that Israel gets away with all your illegal activities only because of the support of the US and if Israel had stood alone it would have had no chance diplomatically across the world ? 
9. Dont you think the attrocities of Israel are so apparent, so damning that there is no discussion on Hamas, or Peace, or for that matter about the Hostages ? This has practically turned the discussion the wrong direction.

This is gifted so you can read it without a subscription.

I linked a piece from today's NYTimes about the IDF tearing up parts of Tulkarm and Jenin, obstructing emergency vehicles, etc. There aren’t many places on Reddit to discuss this from a pro-Israeli perspective, so I genuinely want to hear what you think, without partisan defensive bullshit. From the video and descriptions, it really seems like part of a broader campaign punishing the people there—store owners and the municipal government—for the actions of militants.

For context, I’m a NYC Jew who's always supported Israel's right to exist and defend itself, and I thought the war in Gaza was justified (though leaks about acceptable civilian casualties have been worrying). I  think terms like genocide and apartheid were lazy, reductionist, and pushed by bad actors. That said, reading stuff like this makes me wonder what the hell is going on and makes me second-guess Israel’s intentions in the West Bank and Gaza.

&amp;#x200B;

As we already know that Hamas doesn't care at all about lives of Gaza's civilians (https://www.timesofisrael.com/top-hamas-official-claims-group-is-not-responsible-for-defending-gazan-civilians/) , this is certainly part of the reason that Hamas is so desperate for a ceasefire that will allow them to remain in power. The intelligence trove here will likely keep Mossad busy for months, if not years. And Hamas doesn't want the IDF destroying any more of its terror infrastructure. 

If Hamas cared about civilians in Gaza, they'd be negotiating surrender in exchange for passage out of Gaza (as was done with Arafat and the PLO in Beirut in 1982). But they're counting on the international community to force Israel to allow them to remain in Gaza. 

And UNRWA""s claims that they had no idea this was going on are not in any way credible: 

""The IDF also said that in some of the offices of UNRWA officials, troops found equipment and documents that indicated “that the same offices were also used by Hamas terrorists.”  
“There is no doubt that UNRWA staff knew that \[Hamas\] was digging a massive tunnel beneath them,” Aharon said. “There’s a perimeter wall, a gate, cameras, at the gate they log who comes in and out. Whoever worked at UNRWA knew very well who was coming in, and who they were covering for.”""

&amp;#x200B;

Bottom line:  UNRWA is fatally compromised and needs to be disbanded. Responsibility (and funding) for its operations needs to be redirected to the UNHCR, which is responsible for all other refugees on the planet. UNHCR needs to exercise its mandate to resettle refugees when return is not an option.   The overwhelming majority of Palestinian ""refugees"" are actually not refugees as defined by the UNHCR (""someone who is unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion"") because their ""country of origin"" isn't Israel if they weren't ever living there. But it would seem reasonable to allow UNHCR to provide services for a period of X (5? 10?) years to these non-refugees to assist them in resettlement.

&gt;For nearly two years, Israel has accused Hamas of stealing aid provided by the United Nations and other international organizations. The government has used that claim as its main rationale for restricting food from entering Gaza.

&gt;But the Israeli military never found proof that the Palestinian militant group had systematically stolen aid from the United Nations, the biggest supplier of emergency assistance to Gaza for most of the war, according to two senior Israeli military officials and two other Israelis involved in the matter.

&gt;In fact, the Israeli military officials said, the U.N. aid delivery system, which Israel derided and undermined, was largely effective in providing food to Gaza’s desperate and hungry population.

&gt;Now, with hunger at crisis levels in the territory, Israel is coming under increased international pressure over its conduct of the war in Gaza and the humanitarian suffering it has brought. Doctors in the territory say that an increasing number of their patients are suffering from — and dying of — starvation.

&gt;More than 100 aid agencies and rights groups warned this past week of “mass starvation” and implored Israel to lift restrictions on humanitarian assistance.

2. But before then, the British imperialists violently conquered and then were controlled the area, handing down laws from British Authorities that everyone in British Mandatory Palestine had to follow, Arabs and Jews. Do they think the years of British rule were also occupation?
3. And before then, the Ottoman imperialists violently conquered and then were controlled the area, handing down laws from Turkish authorities that everyone in Southern Syria (the Ottoman name for the area) had to follow, Arabs and Jews. Do they think the years of Ottoman rule were also occupation?
4. And before that, Arab imperialists conquered the area, handing down laws from Turkish authorities that everyone — Jews and Christians — in Jund Falestina had to follow. Plus they forced everyone to speak their language and convert to their religion or live as second-class citizens. Do they think the years of Arab rule were also occupation?
5.

I am sure y'all have noticed how certain subs are just letting incredibly anti semitic sentiment stay up, and anyone calling it out gets their commentary removed and banned.

But the anti semitic content stays up.

I will demonstrate with one simple example that got me banned this morning. There was this comment that blamed the IDF, not Hamas, for the hostage situation. 

I commented against that insane notion and was relatively well upvoted. I was banned for pushing back against anti semitic content, and my comments were removed and the anti semitic content stayed up.

[Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1cewuux/americanisraeli_hostage_appears_in_hamas_video/l1m4vn2/) is the offensive comment in question.

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/FafbEnN) is what I said in response and what got removed.

[Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1cewuux/americanisraeli_hostage_appears_in_hamas_video/l1m5rj5/) is a link to one of my removed comments. 

**I don't expect an outcome from this thread. I just want people to note that reddit allows mods of default subs to elevate pro Hamas speech and remove any defense of Israeli and Jewish people from unjust attacks.**

Btw, I am not even Jewish or Israeli. I just cannot tolerate commentary that ignores that Hamas kidnapped hostages and still holds them ffs.

What exactly is the solution here? While reddit's moderation system has had issues in the past and such issues are by design, default subs should be held to a different standard. Is it really proper for a publicly listed company to have its ""default"" content be branded by pro-Hamas propaganda? Do advertisers want their ads next to commentary glorifying Hamas holding hostages as valid resistance?

Lastly, as I've said before, I am not alone in this issue. I've seen multiple comments in this sub and others were people discuss how mods are not moderating based on the rules of the sub, but what by they want.

None of my comments violated the rules of that sub. As you can see by my discussion with the logs, that doesn't matter. [I am a troll](https://imgur.com/a/ulNH8JD) just for stating that hamas, not the IDF, is at fault for the condition of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. 

To be honest, I think this will continue to be an issue until it is called out. So I encourage users to post in this thread situations where they call out anti-semitic and/or pro-Hamas content, only for moderation to encourage such content.

I think this war we see in Isreal now has nothing to do with land actually I don’t think I know so hamas said so them selves in the hamas convonate
Snippet below 

It is necessary to instill in the minds of the Moslem generations that the Palestinian problem is a religious problem, and should be dealt with on this basis. Palestine contains Islamic holy sites. In it there is al- Aqsa Mosque which is bound to the great Mosque in Mecca in an inseparable bond as long as heaven and earth speak of Isra` (Mohammed's midnight journey to the seven heavens) and Mi'raj (Mohammed's ascension to the seven heavens from Jerusalem).”


Hamas claim they have a right to the land because their prophet went to al - Aqsa mosque for those of us who know history though we know this is not true because it was built after Mohammed’s death but how can anyone not see this conflict right now is taking place because of the religion of “ peace “ in the hamas convonant hamas acknowledged that Muslims gained the land by conquest but they justified this by saying that any land that Muslims have conquered forever belongs to Muslims because this is what allah has commanded can no one see the pattern here ? 


The Quran and Hadith also shows a lot of hate to Jews and Christian’s for some reason dehumanising us calling us the worst of creatures apes pigs and our blood is not sacred not only that look what Hamas had to say about this 


 
&gt;“'Israel will exist and  will  continue  to  exist  until  Islam  will obliterate it, just as it obliterated others before it.' (Preamble)

From Hadith 

&gt;“The Day of Judgment will not come about until Moslems fight Jews and kill them. Then, the Jews will hide behind rocks and trees,  and  the rocks and trees will cry out: 'O Moslem, there is a Jew hiding behind me, come and kill him.”(Article 7)


I mean it’s clear the have the intention to wiping out the Jews 

The also said their can be no peaceful negations I.e two state solution 


&gt;“'[Peace]  initiatives,   and   so-called   peaceful   solutions and nternational conferences are in contradiction to the  principles  of the Islamic Resistance Movement... Those conferences are no more than a means to appoint the  infidels  as  arbitrators  in  the  lands  of Islam... There is no solution for the Palestinian problem  except  by Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are but a waste of time, an exercise in futility.”(Article 13)

Allah's Apostle said, ""I have been ordered to fight the people till they say: 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.' And if they say so, pray like our prayers, face our Qibla and slaughter as we slaughter, then their blood and property will be sacred to us and we will not interfere with them except legally and their reckoning will be with Allah."" Narrated Maimun ibn Siyah that he asked Anas bin Malik,
""O Abu Hamza! What makes the life and property of a person sacred?"" He replied, ""Whoever says, 'None has the right to be worshipped but Allah', faces our Qibla during the prayers, prays like us and eats our slaughtered animal, then he is a Muslim, and has got the same rights and obligations as other Muslims have.""

From what I'm reading and understanding Israel isn't actually required to allow aid in to Gaza at least not anywhere near the level it currently does. They could effectively stop providing or allowing food entirely if they chose and without breaking any laws due Hamas and other groups stealing aid. Even without the issue's of stealing aid they are only required to provide it to children and pregnant women under international law and the burden is on the one providing the aid to distribute it and ensure it only goes to those people. How would the world react if rather then invading Rafah they simply cut off aid or STRICTLY controlled it for only pregnant women and children and actually forced a civilian evacuation so they could deal with the tunnels? This could also work from a PR perspective to show the consequences of Hamas committing war crimes by stealing the aid. And could help dodge the issue of using American weapons in Rafah or the invasion as a whole while helping to push for a proper evacuation in a safe zone. The relevant law requiring aid to civilians in wartime is from Article 23 of the Geneva convention 1949 and specifies the food is for children under 15 and expecting mothers specifically, Additionally there are several exceptions where food can be stopped , That it be diverted from its destination, Control (Distrubition) is not effective, Or a military advantage can be gained or the economy of the enemy benefitted.

1be25x2,IsraelPalestine,"Are Israelis believed to be first owners of the land?  Some pro-Isreali debaters often claim that the Levant belongs to the Jews because ""they were there first."" But that claim comes off to me as illegitimate when the Jewish Bible itself contradicts that when it says that they, the Israelites, invaded the land after fleeing Egypt and killed the ""evil"" Canaanites, supposedly under God's permission.

The debate is whether the former rhetoric has any basis in history (which maybe I might have missed), or just an invention to defend the take-over of the Levant by european jews. 

My guess would be that most Israelis assimilated with the Canaanites instead of wiping them off as the Bible claims, which the research also suggests. However it wouldn't be too far fetched to think that there was a lot of fighting between the two populations. 

Fighting had also happened on numerous occasions after the land became majority Israeli by invading empires. Most prominently by the Arabs after the 7th century, which also make up a significant portion of the population today. But we believe the Muslims and Arabs living there to be invaders whilst we don't for the Jews. Strinkingly, european Jews also get a free claim to it for non-obvious or faulty reasons (to me it seems)

Either way it wouldn't be right to claim Israelites as the sole legitimate owner of the land, given how their own historical record describes them as foreigners of the land: a far cry from the ""natives since the beginning"" they believe themselves to be.

These are the latest updates on day 687 of the war:

The IDF announced the death of 1st Lieutenant Ori Gerlic, a platoon commander in the Shimshon Battalion of the Kfir Brigade, in an operational accident in the southern Gaza Strip.

The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said that 61 Palestinians were killed and 308 were wounded and reached hospitals across the Gaza Strip over the last 24 hours.

Thousands of people protested in Tel Aviv on Saturday afternoon, calling for an end to the war and to prevent the growing hunger in the Gaza Strip. Demonstrators held signs reading ""Stop the genocide"" and displayed photos of Palestinian children suffering from malnutrition.

Opposition Knesset member Benny Gantz, chair of the centrist Blue and White party, called on Saturday evening to form a government tasked with securing the return of all hostages held in Gaza and drafting a bill for Haredi conscription within weeks.

Thousands of Israelis are rallying across the country on Saturday evening, calling for a hostage deal and an end to the war in Gaza

1kaln5i,IsraelPalestine,"People don't understand the Jewish experience worldwide I'm not Jewish. But I've lived in Israel for several years, and came to understand Judaism more than most across the world.

I no longer live in Israel, but I'm in touch with the Jewish community here.

It's clear to me that in Reddit, people seem very unaware of the worldwide Jewish experience during this war, outside of Israel. Understanding this helps put this conflict into this perspective, and puts serious doubt on a lot of the beliefs and claims about Israel and Palestine.

**1. Jews aren't safe.**   
  
Except for in very closed communities, like in New York perhaps, all the Jews I know can't speak Hebrew in public, hide their Jewish symbols, can't wear Kippahs in public, and have to be very careful to hide their Jewishness. This is the experience I've seen in London, Spain, Canada, and for travelers across Europe. Hate crime has been the most severe against Jews compared to against other minorities, even in the safest countries for them such as the US and UK.   
  
**2. People attack Jews due to the war.**  
  
These attacks mentioned above are higher than ever due to the war. This shows beyond doubt that for many many people, there is no separation between Israel and Jews, in spite of what I see many people believe or claim here on Reddit.

**3. Jews overwhelmingly support Israel.**

Liberal Jews, conservative Jews, Orthodox Jews, the vast vast majority of Jews in the world support Israel's existence and support Israel in this current war. The Jews people point to that oppose Israel is a clear case of Tokenization.",,

193v7wk,AskMiddleEast,"Off my chest, Saudi Arabia 

Disclaimer: I am a Saudi Doctor working abroad. 

Another disclaimer, downvotes prove my point. 

Prologue 

If anything bad comes, it comes from me, if its good, it is from god. 

In a messed up world where everyone is quick to judge and slow to understand. Saudi Arabia as a nation stands in an extremely shrouded misconceptions and misconstrued narratives that are not made within its borders. Expectations and judgements that conflicts with each other. Geopolitical unfairness and more societal complexities that are intentionally disregarded for clout reasons. This will not be a good read for those who already choose to live their lives in an ignorant hateful approach for people and monarchs of which they have never even met realistically.


Main points 

• Misrepresentation in Media:

Since 1960s, The western propaganda machine has been loading its heaviest guns against Saudi Arabia. 1/20 times where the kingdom is represented in a good light, and that is only when a financial deal or public approval for a certain bill needs to be passed. There has been an emphasis on – extremism – oppression, and wealth. This is not fair while overlooking the reality of western countries destroying practically all arab countries with their “democracy ✨” and overlooking complexity and diversity of saudis in general. 
                   -religion - tribal system- moral system- family importance, etc… 

—Yemen war: The Yemen war is massively false reported in western media like insanity. Its depicted like “MBS suddenly woke up and chose to bomb all yemen for no reason”. Saudi never intervened in yemen until their “rightful” “democratic” president [plead](https://durham-repository.worktribe.com/OutputFile/1334388) to saudi and the Arabic league for intervention due to iran actions with houthis. 

— Saudia did not lose the war, not in the slightest, sure, objectively lost. Not militarly. Saudi has withdrawn from yemen because they understood the game iran is playing. Its the same they shoved Hamas to do in israel, prolonged war with media war. 


— فلسطين، and the american military base called israel in relation to Saudi Arabia: 

It is puzzling to me how people genuinely believe that Saudi Arabia was just gonna quick sell Palestinians and erase the case that one of our [kings died for](https://web.archive.org/web/20210110033405/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VbsdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2EYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6896,4366537), and just forget they existed for a trading route and intel contract? Saudi has aramco, it will go broke after 200 or 300 years of lavishly spending. Use your mind when approaching this.

People are quick to jump to accusations while disregarding the reasoning of Saudi decision making. Saudi are not siding with iran not because they are shia. Saudi sunni may believe shia are not muslim or whatever, but the reason is apparent. Look at Iraq, Syria, yemen, salman al ouda, qutb, Lebanon and southern turkey.  Saudi is not siding with a monster criminal state against another monster criminal state. Iran is killing more muslims than israel.

 This does not mean Saudia will just ignore both, ( although it can, no one cares when saudi gets attacked or damaged) MBS holds gatherings, pressures decision makers and gives a podium for people to demonstrate their country needs. Its just you cant help someone who sold you for your enemy. 

This highlights the extreme complexity of political playground that people make reality of without understanding it. Just feeding their brains of the headlines

** indian BJP OR PJB OR something visit to medina ** good muslim wannabes often are head on to critique the kingdom for either authority dopamine or good preacher dopamine. Any how, this shows the lack of understanding of alot of muslims, medina and the masjid al nabawi are not prohibited to enter for non-muslims by islam.  [Masjid Al haram is prohibited for non-Muslims,](https://binbaz.org.sa/fatwas/2287) in addition to the amazing fact the she was not even let inside that mosque, its just the automatic hate train.
 
• UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS: 
I have lived long enough to see people accuse saudi arabia for being uncivilised, radical, behind and uneducated. Those same people today are on twitter, on this subreddit and r/geopolitics are calling Saudis servants of israel, zionists and America. Or the Saudis are destroying islam. Saudis can genuinely use the “Antisemitism” card more than jews because its almost deplorable how much you do you are still the boogie man. 

The topic of israel, saudi and iran is not for the simple minded. Geopolitics is much more complicated than forming an opinion from youtube videos or your atheist uncle who lives in oregon and curses Saudi Arabia on twitter. Saudi leadership has decided to make peace with everyone in the region to fix the mess the west has caused, saudi CAN NOT go with their vision for 2030 without making massive amendments in the region. So kindly, educate yourself before yapping. 

Reform being in all aspects in saudi highlighted that if you do or you dont you will be hated anyway, so do it without care. 

Epilogue (TL:DR):- 

I am genuinely calling for everyone in the region to be open for a fair, nuanced, open balanced dialogue regarding the Kingdom. Challenging the perceived automatic biases in the west and understanding the geopolitical mess our region is in at the moment. Tackling the expectations of reforms and international diplomacy at the same time. There is so much intricacy in the region and its our responsibility to deal with it in the years to come.

Thanks

1kvp7oz,IsraelPalestine,"IDF is full of terrorists What’s happening in Gaza and the West Bank is just awful and heartbreaking. Entire families are being wiped out, children buried under rubble, homes and hospitals turned to dust — and it keeps happening. Yet no one bats an eye. It’s like the world has become numb, like it's somehow normal that dozens of Palestinians are murdered every single day. Every airstrike, every sniper shot, every demolished home is treated like a statistic instead of a human life lost. Israel claims it’s acting in self-defense, but how do you justify bombing refugee camps, targeting schools, or cutting off food, water, electricity, and medical aid to an entire population? This isn’t defense. It’s collective punishment. It’s apartheid. It’s a war on civilians.

Human rights organizations around the world — Amnesty, Human Rights Watch, UN investigators — have all said it loud and clear: these are war crimes. And this didn’t start on October 7. This is the result of decades of violence, dehumanization, and occupation. In 1948, over 700,000 Palestinians were ethnically cleansed during the Nakba when Israel was established on stolen land. Since then, generations have lived under military rule, siege, checkpoints, blockades, and bombs.

This is not a conflict between two equal sides. One side has one of the most powerful militaries in the world. The other is fighting to survive. Demanding an end to this horror is not hate, it’s humanity. It's about justice, dignity, and freedom for a people who have been denied all three for far too long.

So how are people defending idf? how can anyone justify this genocide? it's insane to me",,

1av150y,IsraelPalestine,"Do Palestinians support or oppose Hamas? I’ve heard both sides of this question, from both Zionists and pro-Palestinians. And believe it or not, *both sides argue for both sides of this question*, but disagree with the other side whenever a discussion happens.

Some Zionists tell me that Palestinians generally hate Hamas, citing stories of Hamas abusing Palestinians and Palestinian protests against Hamas, then say Israel is “freeing Palestine from Hamas”. Other Zionists say Palestinians are generally Hamas supporters, cite recent polling, and say that Hamas is deeply entwined with civilians who willingly act as human shields.

Some pro-Palestinians say Palestinians generally hate Hamas and see them as nothing more as a lesser evil to Israel, and they consider the current situation as Israel punishing innocents for the crimes of people they don’t even like. Other pro-Palestinians say Palestinians support Hamas, they tell me that Hamas crimes are fabricated by hasbara, that Hamas is actually really brave and noble people offering a civilized resistance against Israel in line with the best ideals of Islam.

I am totally and utterly confused. When I see these discussions happens, it’s a coin flip on which side takes which position. And whatever position one side takes, the other side will disagree and take the other position. Does either side of this conflict have any real beliefs on this or is it just whatever position can be used to attack the other side?

Is there any internal discussion on this topic within a side? Like do Zionists debate with other Zionists whether Palestinians are Hamas supporters and do pro-Palestinians have a similar discussion internally?",,
19f788z,IsraelPalestine,"I condemn oct 7 attacks but do you condemn those massacres ? For many years, the Zionist occupation, which has never wavered from its policy of destruction, sabotage, and displacement of the owners of the land, has not been devoid of bloodshed, attacks on sanctuaries, and violations of honors against the Palestinians by Zionist gangs. 

Here are the post-1948 massacres:  
  
\*Jaffa Massacre: The Old Saraya massacre, which took place in April 1948 by the ""Haganah"" gangs, where the aim of the operation was to seize the Arab neighborhoods in Haifa and was an important event in the final stages of the war of ethnic cleansing in Palestine, which led to the Arab-Israeli war in 1948.  
  
\*Deir Yassin Massacre: A mass extermination and expulsion carried out in April 1948 by the Irgun and Stern Zionist groups in the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin, west of Jerusalem. Most of the victims of the massacre were civilians, including children, women and the elderly, and the number of martyrs ranges between 250 and 360 according to Arab and Palestinian sources, and 109 according to Western sources.  
  
\* Tantoura Massacre:  About a month after the Deir Yassin massacre, and to complete the main Zionist goal of ethnic cleansing of the country, by force of arms and intimidation of the population in preparation for the displacement of the largest number of Palestinians, the Tantoura massacre came. It had a profound impact on Palestinians in neighboring villages and set the stage for their actual displacement.  
  
This massacre differs from all previous massacres in Palestine, not only because of the size of the victims, but also because it was committed by the Israeli occupation army, one week after the declaration of the establishment of the State of Israel. The occupation army chose this particular village because of its location on the Mediterranean coast, and the ease of attacking it, under the pretext that the village represents a threat to them, and they accused its inhabitants of turning it into a harbor from which weapons reach the Palestinians.  
\*The Qibya Massacre: It took place on the night between October 14 and 15, 1953, when Israeli soldiers under the command of Ariel Sharon attacked the village of Qibya, located in the West Bank (which was then under Jordanian sovereignty). 69 Palestinians were martyred, many of them while hiding in their homes, which were bombed. 45 houses, one school and a mosque were demolished.  
\*Qalqilya Massacre: A massacre carried out by the Israeli occupation army and a group of settlers on October 10, 1956 against unarmed Palestinian citizens in the village of Qalqilya, located on the Green Line separating the Arab territories occupied in 1948 from the West Bank, where an army detachment, an artillery battalion and ten fighter planes participated in the attack. The occupation army shelled the village with artillery before storming it, where more than 70 martyrs were killed.  
\*Kafr Qassem Massacre: A massacre carried out by Israeli border guards on October 29, 1956 against unarmed Palestinian citizens in the village of Kafr Qassem, in which 49 Arab martyrs were killed: The occupation government led by Ben-Gurion tried to cover up the massacre and prevent it from being publicized.  
The border policemen involved in the shooting were prosecuted, convicted and sentenced to prison, but all were pardoned and released within a year. The brigade commander was sentenced to pay a nominal fine. The Israeli court found that the order to kill civilians was ""blatantly unlawful.""  
\*The Khan Younis Massacre:  On November 12, 1956, the occupation army carried out a massacre of Palestinian refugees in the Khan Younis camp in the southern Gaza Strip, killing more than 250 Palestinian martyrs. Nine days after the first massacre on November 12, 1956, a unit of the occupation army carried out another brutal massacre, killing about 275 civilians in the same camp, and more than a hundred other Palestinians from the Rafah refugee camp were martyred on the same day. This massacre extended to the borders of the town of Bani Suhaila.  
\*Sabra and Shatila massacre: It is a massacre carried out in the Sabra and Shatila Palestinian refugee camps on September 16, 1982 and lasted for three days by Lebanese groups represented by the Lebanese Phalange Party, the South Lebanon Army, and the occupation army. The number of people killed in the massacre is not clearly known, with estimates ranging from 750 to 3,500 civilian men, children, women and elderly, mostly Palestinians but including Lebanese as well. At the time, the camp was completely surrounded by the South Lebanon Army and the occupation army, which was under the command of Ariel Sharon and Raphael Eitan, while the Lebanese Forces command was under the command of Elie Hobeika, an influential Phalangist official.

Most of the pro-Israel do not know this evil history of Zionism .

1hz4gff,IsraelPalestine,"Independent Media Access Restrictions in Gaza 

Should Israel reduce restrictions on independent media access to Gaza?

I understand that Israel argues these restrictions are necessary to protect its military operations, but how valid is that claim? Of course, security during conflict is important, but there has to be some balance, right? When access is cut off, it leaves a massive information gap, and in that gap, it becomes way too easy for narratives—on both sides—to spiral out of control. Without journalists on the ground, how are we supposed to figure out what’s real and what’s propaganda?

Take the civilian death toll in Gaza, for example. Right now, those numbers come from the Gaza health ministry, and people immediately question their credibility because of the obvious bias. But wouldn’t letting independent journalists in help clear some of this up? If the numbers are inflated, as some pro-Israel voices claim, that could actually work in Israel’s favor by strengthening its case in the court of public opinion. And if the numbers are accurate—or even worse than reported—wouldn’t it be better to have hard evidence out there instead of relying on speculation and assumptions?

It’s hard to ignore how much conflicting information is out there right now. Honestly, it feels impossible to tell what’s true and what’s spin. Both sides are pushing their own narratives, and regular people—people like us—are stuck in the middle, trying to sort it all out. If independent journalists had the freedom to report, they could show us what’s actually happening—not just death tolls, but also the reality of life in Gaza, the aftermath of airstrikes, and the broader impact of the conflict on civilians.

This kind of transparency matters. It wouldn’t just help the global audience understand what’s happening; it could also hold everyone involved more accountable. Governments and organizations rely on public pressure to act, and without accurate information, that pressure either doesn’t build or ends up misplaced.

It seem fairly obvious that when reporters can’t get in and do their jobs, misinformation thrives. Tik tok, Reddit posts, and general Social media fills the gaps with rumors, conspiracy theories, and doctored images, and the truth gets drowned out. Trust in the media is already shaky enough—why make it worse by shutting out the people whose job it is to get the facts?

At the end of the day, this isn’t about picking sides. It’s about transparency and accountability. Whether you support Israel, Palestine, or just want to see an end to the violence, you’d probably agree that we deserve to know what’s actually happening. If we can’t rely on accurate reporting, we’re left in the dark, and that helps no one.

So, should Israel allow more independent journalists into Gaza? I certainly think so. Because without transparency, there’s no way to fully understand this conflict, let alone find a way forward to lasting peace.",,

after all the name Palestine not them who made it and even this flag,  
the flag came from the Arab revolution and the name was the old Greece that made it up for the region, the land was being called by the Jew I think Israel and by the Arab land of Cannan, and by the Egyptians Palstim.

[First, from Hamza, a Palestinian:](https://x.com/HowidyHamza/status/1902065122660773946)

&gt; What does it take to surrender? The human souls? We lost enough.  

&gt; The city? Totally destroyed.  

&gt; Those who survived? Barely trying to survive one more day.  

&gt; Yet Hamas refuses. Not out of strength, not out of strategy, but because surrender means facing their own failure. It means admitting that all of this—the loss, the destruction, the unimaginable suffering—was for nothing. And that is something they cannot bear.  

&gt; So they hold on. Not for the people, not for Gaza, but for themselves. Because to surrender would be to let go of the power they’ve built, the control they’ve maintained, and the narrative they’ve spun for decades. They are not the ones searching for food in the rubble. They are not the ones watching their children waste away. They sit in safety while others pay the price.  

&gt; How much more is there to lose before they decide it’s enough? Or is the truth that they never will—because the suffering of Gaza has never been their concern, only their weapon.

[And then from Haviv Rettig Gur, an Israeli:](https://twitter.com/havivrettiggur/status/1902102717637497307)

&gt; This is the best articulation of the Hamas tragedy I’ve read in a long time.

&gt; **It’s a classic example of the sunk costs fallacy. If Israel is not actually removable, then the safety and happiness of generations of Palestinians were sacrificed to a vast and foolish miscalculation by ruthless and incompetent ideologues.** (emphasis mine)

&gt; Since that’s too painful to contemplate, every time they fail to destroy the Jews, they double down on the claim that it’s nevertheless possible.

&gt; And thus are another generation’s safety and prosperity sacrificed yet again on the crumbling old altar of Israel’s destruction.

&gt; If they knew the first thing about us, if they saw us as real people with a real story rather than ideological constructs and cartoon villains shrunk to the needs of a racist ideology, they could pivot, repair and rebuild. But that would require a whole new Palestinian elite, a new willingness to learn about us, and a new capacity to think unromantically about their strategic options.

&gt; People often say Palestinians need a nonviolent unifier and mobilizer like Mandela or King. They actually need a wise and unsentimental strategist, a Herzl. 

If Palestine is not ultimately victorious in its maximalist goal of destroying Israel and building an Arab Muslim state ""from the river to the sea,"" then all of the suffering (yes suffering) of Palestinians for the past 70 years has been for naught. 

To have sacrificed decades of times, billions of dollars, and tens of thousands of lives just to end up with what would be essentially what they would have gotten if they had accepted the partition plan would be to admit that those tens of thousands of lives have been lost for nothing, and that thought is unthinkable. 

So Palestine keeps pushing the boulder up the hill, keeps fighting a fight that even its supporters think is unwinnable, because to leave the boulder where it is would be to admit all those years pushing it were wasted. 

That's a bitter pill to swallow but the alternative is worse. Let us all hope that Palestine swallows that bill and thinks the unthinkable, otherwise this conflict will just drag on.",,

Usually when fighting a war, it's common practice that the loser gives up territory to the victorious, so how come that was never in the picture following the 2.WW? I get that Jews have religious ties connected to the area prior known as Palestine, but at the time, the zionists were also contemplating establishing their nation in Argentina? The aftermaths of Holocaust still exists today, which is one of the reasons Germany wouldn't dare to interfere with Israels warfare strategies/politics. But if they are really that sorry, why weren't they the first ones to offer a piece of their land after the 2.WW? No matter how grotesque this may sound, they must've had quite some space after wiping out 6 million Jews. And besides a lot of western countries believe that Israel share a lot of western values, (which I'm not too sure about, after having seen their methods.) but wouldn't it then had made greater sense if they were located within Europe? 

  
No matter how we twist and turn the situation, it is indisputable that both Israel and Palestine carry a great responsibility for the things that have happened. But in the end the one with the dirtiest hands remains the western countries with USA in front. Their behavior is unacceptable. I can't fathom how the western countries can see themselves as civilized, evolved and superior, when their existence is the sole reason that thousands of innocents get killed every day. They don't wanna deal with problems, so they send them elsewhere. And when things escalate, they'll turn the blind eye.

So, I don't watch news. Maybe that's on me. I don't watch it though because *this* station favors *this* political party or side of the war, people, ect. That's why I'm on here for people to help me explain what's going on. Please don't judge me for that, I prefer people actually telling me what's going on rather than some news station, and I don't talk about it to peoppe in person because they're biased.
So, let me just say like...what's in my head. Maybe someone can help me otherwise. 
My uncle served in the military when 9/11 happened. So growing up, I always thought that Iraq/Iran, pretty much the entire Middle East were the bad guys, or ""terrorists."" Meanwhile I grew up believing in God (my parents didn't, it wasn't a religious household, but my grandma did. Pretty much she is a religion nut) so I grew up thinking the Isreal people were like...""God's people"" you know? 
So when this war first happened, I felt bad for the Israelites because, as I said, they were God's people. The holy land. Time has passed, blah blah blah, I kinda am at a time where I don't know what to believe (religion), you know? Anyway, its not the problem. But there's so many people who are on Palestine's side. Why? Aren't the the terrorists who did all sorts of attacks like 9/11, bombings, ect?
And many people hate Isreal. Why? Aren't they the ""God's"" children?
It kinda sounds like people before kinda had their side to ""root""? for. Now it's like everyone's with Palestine's side. Isn't that glorifying the ""terrorists""? 
I'm kinda at the point of like...I don't really care about either of them, because they're supposedly both bad countries, right? Well that's why I'm here for someone to explain.

I'm not trying to troll anyone or to provoke. I have a train of thoughts I'll try to break down to try and explain the logic behind what I'm saying, hopefully, to shed light for outsiders on what is going inside the head of a typical Israeli these days.

Edit: The astonishing amount of Muslims here threatening me on Jihad and cleansing all Jews from Israel are living proof for my next paragraphs.

I see many Westerners tending to write, ""*I don't understand why I can't talk to an Israeli; they're so hard and can't listen to anything; they keep repeating the same things.*"" Yes, you are right. You can't get through. The 7 October was such a traumatic event for us that it blacked out our logic. We are irrational. We are mad. You are correct about these assumptions.

# It's all about the repressed memories of the holocaust and past wars of the Israel-Arab world.

""*Ah yes... again, the Jews whining about the holocaust, quit it*"". We can't. I am fed with this memory from age five until I'm dead. I have been to the German death camps in Poland.

I have been hearing stories every year. And not just the holocaust. The stories on the war of 1948, 1967, 1973 (probably the biggest impact here), 1982, 2006, and countless terror attacks by PLO over the years. We were constantly told that they would attack again. They will look to destroy you because you are a jew.

Horror stories about German soldiers raping Jewish women and teens, Horror stories about Arabs doing the same in 1948. Horrors from across a thousand years of Jews living in exile. Almost every nation on earth did it to us.

And yet... I, the modern Israeli Jew, listening to all these stories, and I do admit I said, ""*Nah, that's past, it won't happen again, nobody is so mad to execute it again.*"" Like what? We have the strongest military in the Middle East and the best intelligence in the region (conspiracies, please head over to /r/conspiracy); who will ever attempt to try such atrocities again?!

And then, 7 October.

At once, all these horrors erupted again. in a live stream. In modern Israel. Who have thought?! The same stories from 1940's are happening in 2023.

I was crying for a week. My whole world and beliefs collapsed. [I wrote this post just a few days after](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/176dr12/open_letter_to_hamas_and_gaza/) the 7 October. 

Looking back, it's almost a self-fulfilling prophecy:

&gt;They will cross the border soon, and you will see what is real occupation. You will spend the coming winter in tiny tents because even Egypt refuses to help you. And there, outside the tents will stand Jewish soldiers, looking at you with empty eyes and black hearts. Making sure you won't even think about normal life anytime soon.And we won't care what the world would say.

&amp;#x200B;

The amount of rage, fear, and repressed memories exploded so hard. The Israeli Jews have a total blackout regarding the other side. The promise ""Never again"" is true; we will pay any price to ensure it. Truly. Even at the cost of destruction and death in the size the world hasn't seen since WW2.

Yes, to some degree, we have this stupid pride to show the world - ""You don't f\*\*\* with the Jews like that ever again.""

# Why wouldn't you listen to the world? Don't you worry about sanctions? Boycotting?

Say we will agree. We'll stop and withdraw back. What the world will do to ensure it won't happen again? How \***you**\* going to solve the problem? A Palestinian state? If they will attack us again as an independent state, what will \*you\* do? Protest for Israel? How's that going to help us?

See, we don't trust you to solve it for us. Normally, I agree that scaring us off with sanctions and boycotting would do the work. But I'm (and my fellow Israelis) still fueled by the fear and memories of generations. We will endure it. Israel was almost a pariah state in the past (1970's); we can do it again. I prefer to live in security and relieve my existential fear that someone is trying to kill me because I am a jew, and being a poor and unwanted in the world.

# The death of the Israeli left-wing beliefs

You should mourn it more than anything. I am a moderate-left wing. I supported a two-state solution for a long time, but now I'm unsure what to think. There is no future for this solution.

We must face the truth and the reality of what is coming next: Gaza will drown under the iron boots of Israel. This is the bleak future waiting for both sides, as Israelis cannot trust the other side anymore. The trust went to absolute zero. There are no voices in Israel against this plan; both sides agree this is the next logical step.

I do not pity Gazans. As I do not pity Germans suffering from Allied attacks in WW2, as I do not pity any nation that is trying to kill me. The horrors and deaths Israelis have seen in the past half year are going to be deeply engraved in Jewish history for centuries to come. This is another memorial for the sad history of the Jews and their efforts to find a place under the sun.

You don't have to agree. You can still watch the region sinking into an illogical war. I just hope you can understand the Israeli emotional drive to keep fighting.

1ck3m92,IsrealPalestineWar_23,"Hamas Accepts Gaza Cease-fire Deal; Israeli Officials Stand Firm 
According to recent reports, there have been developments in the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel. Here are the key points:

1. **Hamas Accepts Cease-fire Deal:**
   - The U.S. has put forward an ""extraordinarily generous"" offer for a Gaza truce and hostage release deal.
   - The proposal includes a 40-day truce in exchange for the release of hostages and the possibility of displaced families returning to northern Gaza.
   - It also addresses Hamas's demand for a permanent ceasefire by introducing new wording related to restoring calm⁴.

2. **Israeli Stance:**
   - Israeli officials reject the idea of ending the war as part of any deal.
   - Israel remains determined to enter Rafah, a southern city in Gaza.
   - The Israeli government faces pressure from global allies and hostage families to reach an agreement⁴.

3. **Background:**
   - The conflict began when Hamas terrorists invaded Israel in October, prompting Israel's military campaign.
   - Over 1,200 people were killed, and 253 others were taken hostage during the initial attack.
   - Mediators from Egypt, Qatar, and the U.S. have been working to secure a pause in fighting and the release of remaining hostages⁴.

4. **Hamas's Demands:**
   - Hamas insists on a permanent ceasefire leading to a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza.
   - They also want displaced Palestinians to return to their homes.
   - Previous proposals were rejected, but the current one differs significantly from earlier offers⁴.

In summary, while Hamas has accepted the cease-fire deal, Israeli officials remain firm in their stance. The situation remains complex, and negotiations continue⁴⁵.

1acf9h6,IsraelPalestine,"Saudi Arabia's diplomatic skills are top-notch. Saudi Arabia isn't just wealthy, but also has notably weak military capabilities, which has become apparent under the strikes from the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Yet, despite being a rich country with a less-than-impressive military, it hasn't ended up as a 'fattened pig for the slaughter' over the past half-century. Can this be solely explained by Saudi Arabia taking shelter under a bigger power and acting as their 'lapdog'? It's clear from recent events that Saudi Arabia isn't anyone's 'lapdog'; the country maintains a high degree of political independence.

The existence of a country like Saudi Arabia essentially disproves many of the sweeping statements we see online from armchair politicians. Claims like ""If you're rich but lack military power, you're just a fattened pig for the slaughter,"" ""Countries with US military bases lose their political independence,"" or ""Being an enemy of the US is dangerous, but being an ally is fatal,"" don't necessarily hold water.

At the end of the day, I believe it boils down to Saudi Arabia's exceptionally high level of diplomatic skill. Here are a few highlights:

During the various Middle East wars, countries like Egypt, Syria, and Jordan suffered heavily, while Saudi Arabia came out with little to no damage. When Egypt could no longer withstand the pressure and compromised with Israel, Saudi Arabia and other nations stripped Egypt of its status as the 'big brother' of the Arab world. From that point on, Saudi Arabia in effect became the leader of the Arab world. Egypt's so-called ""peace with Israel"" came after immense suffering and sacrifice, and it was shunned by the Arab world. In contrast, after establishing the oil-dollar relationship with the US, Saudi Arabia significantly eased its relations with Israel, and yet it didn't bear much of a moral burden.

In the early 70s, during the oil crisis, OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, dealt a severe blow to the economies of the US, Europe, and Japan, allowing the Soviet Union to profit enormously from the rising oil and gas prices. But why wasn't Saudi Arabia punished by the West? Was it protected by the Soviet Union? No, especially since Saudi Arabia later took a pro-US stance. The reality is Saudi Arabia astutely judged that post-Vietnam War, the US no longer had the will to interfere with Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia.

On the other hand, Saudi Arabia didn't use the oil crisis to strike at the West just for the sake of it. While striking, they secretly signed deals with the US, creating the oil-dollar scheme in partnership. They not only demonstrated their strategic value but also firmly secured that value in their hands. And this time, they didn't just rely on energy; they also stepped into the high-end financial sector.

In the 80s, with the Arab world facing the deep ideological impact of the Iranian Islamic Revolution, Saudi Arabia, as the wealthiest Middle Eastern nation and guardian of the holy cities, didn't confront Iran directly. Instead, they supported Iraq from behind the scenes. The long conflict left Iran exhausted and curbed its momentum of exporting the revolution. At the same time, Iraq, the only country that could have potentially challenged Saudi Arabia's status after Egypt was sidelined, was significantly weakened. Of course, there was one remaining issue: Iraq's military was strong. Then came the Gulf War, where Saudi Arabia used the might of the US to eliminate the military threat from Iraq. Throughout this entire process, Saudi Arabia remained untouched by the ravages of war.

From the 80s to the 90s, against the backdrop of international dynamics, Saudi Arabia started exporting more extreme religious factions abroad, which also helped to alleviate the domestic pressure from their own extreme Wahhabi sect. Then came the 9/11 attacks in 2001, most of the terrorists involved were Saudis, including Osama bin Laden himself, who came from a prominent Saudi family. Did Saudi get implicated in this? Nope. Thanks to their special relationship with the oil-political dynasties in the US, Saudi got off scot-free and even watched as the US took down Iraq. Back then, the thought was that Iran would be next on the US's hit list. Of course, in the end, the Iranians stood their ground with their own tactics and managed to withstand the pressure from the US. But at least, in the aftermath of 9/11, Saudi not only escaped unscathed but also managed to use the situation to their advantage.

When the Arab Spring broke out in 2011, Saudi Arabia decisively used force and money to control the domestic situation and immediately sent troops to suppress the unrest in Bahrain, quickly stabilizing the situation. In contrast, let's look at Egypt. Egypt was also a staunch US ally, and Mubarak's loyalty to the US could probably match any Saudi king's. And Egypt paid a much higher price in its compromises with the US than Saudi Arabia did (who actually profited). So what happened? When things got chaotic domestically, Mubarak was abandoned by the US.

Moving to the last decade, with the development of shale gas in the US and the rise of China, Saudi has been increasingly leaning towards China and Russia. So much so that they've openly snubbed Biden. What can the US really do to Saudi? It doesn't seem like much, not even proper economic sanctions.

And if we think back to Saudi's relationship with China, that's a long game that started back in the 80s with missile purchases...

If you had to point out any major diplomatic blunders for Saudi over the years, it would be their poor performance in supporting the war in Syria and intervening in Yemen. Much of this was due to their weak military. But to be honest, you can't really blame the decision-makers for that. It's just unexpected to see such military ineffectiveness on paper. Even with these mistakes, Saudi has shown adaptability in recent years, improving relations with Iran-linked countries, accepting China's mediation, and thus reaping significant benefits.

In summary, Saudi's diplomacy is commendable. In the Muslim world, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Pakistan all have a high level of external conflict and strategic gameplay. We've all seen Iran's actions. I've previously praised Pakistan as well. These three countries, considering their own national conditions and international situations, have each carved out a very unconventional path in foreign affairs.

I used to think hereditary rule wasn't great, but North Korea and Saudi Arabia have made me realize my prejudice against it was too deep. Now, in my eyes, the hereditary system of governance, intelligence agency rule, theocratic democracy, and capitalist representative democracy are all on the same level.",,

1n1hptt,IsraelPalestine,"The partition’s fairness as towards percentage of land To preface this: my question isn’t a “gotcha” but rather an attempt to actually understand a position. Because I see this come up again and again.

I often see pro-Palestinian voices argue that the 1947 UN Partition Plan was unfair because the proposed state of Israel was allocated about 55% of the land, while the proposed state of Palestine was allocated 45%. That while Israel was to be 50% Jewish, 40% Arab and 10% Bedouin, it was an injustice to give Israel more land than the majority Arab state of Palestine.

But when you look at the details, most of the “extra” land given to Israel was the Negev desert, which in 1947 was almost entirely arid and non-arable. From what I’ve read, according to UN analyses from the time, only around 10%ish of cultivable land was in the Jewish portion, while the Arab state would have controlled over 80% of the arable farmland.

Put another way: The Jewish state got more square mileage, but much of it was desert. The Arab state got less land overall, but most of the fertile farmland.

That raises my question: Why is the “55% vs 45%” talking point repeated so often, while the far more important issue of arable vs. non-arable land is left out?

Also I’m *really* not looking for a discussion on whether the partition should have happened. What atrocities from either side lead up to it. What happened after the partition failed.

Also, yes, Jews owned about 7% of the arable land. Arabs owned 15-20%. And the rest was state land. I get that. But I really hope that if personal ownership comes up it is in the context of the question at hand, and not a tangent. Not that it isn’t interesting, but that I’m hoping that this post can keep the scope of the discussion narrowed to this point.",,

I’m currently working on a short documentary film that includes themes of war, destruction, and daily life. I’m specifically looking for horizontal (landscape format) video footage filmed by ordinary people in Gaza – not news agency material, but raw, personal, amateur clips.

– destruction of the city
– aftermath of bombings
– people living through the war
– silent shots, moving moments, fragments of reality

Some time ago, I was talking to a friend from Syria and her friends who were also from the levant. She mentioned that she thinks of Iran as more “Asia than Middle East”, and all of her friends said they think the same. They also mentioned how everything in Iran is a competition and what they described it seemed to indicate they think of Iran as some sort of cold, Machiavellian, almost socially Darwinist culture. 

Now, I strongly doubt this friend and her crew, given their circumstances, represent any large group of people, but this got me thinking: What are some general cultural traits and behaviors you’ve noticed in Iranians that are distinct from your own? 

I’m more interested in answers that are not at the level of them being Shia or less/more religious than another country. For example, to me, Levantines and Iranians feel like they have a different cultural fabric in a way I find hard to explain. It does seem to me that Levantine people I’ve met are more cheerful, more in the moment, less “ivory tower” (for the lack of a better word), and generally more outwardly emotional. However, I acknowledge that it’s fully possible this may either be biased towards the rich ones who have left their country, or else be a result of internalized anti-Arab bias that has stuck in my mind despite my attempts at fully eradicating any trace of my teenage years’ Iranian hyper nationalism, making me see selectively see things in negative light.",,

Some will say, so what, your power is from the USA. They will say: Without USA you are nothing. 

I am not sure I agree with this. But even it is true, this is evidence that international diplomacy is valuable and Israel is better at it. Why doesn't the USA give Palestine the F-35? Or even Turkey? 

They will say we better at lobbying, or something like that. But even if it is true, how it this our fault? 

It is their fault for not being good at lobbying. They have natural alliances with nearly all oil exporting countries. It's not like we the Israeli Jewish people have some natural edge over them. 

We obviously made our case with skill and for this reason America sells us the F-35 and other things, as well as provides us military aid.

“90% of U.S. aid sent through agents in Gaza ended up in Hamas-controlled areas. This is beyond absurd. In effect, American assistance kept Hamas afloat until the ceasefire was pushed through weeks ago.”

Mr. Roman: “That’s correct. And it goes even further—Samantha Power, the USAID administrator, was actively working to prevent Israel from defending itself.”
