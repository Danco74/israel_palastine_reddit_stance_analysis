    "## **Project Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "We measure how Reddit's stance toward Israel and Palestine evolves over time using \n",
    "a daily-updated Kaggle dataset. This notebook provides an end-to-end workflow: \n",
    "load and clean data, draw stratified samples, hand-label stance, visualize patterns, \n",
    "and prepare baseline models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Goal:** Quantify stance toward each side over time and identify shifts \n",
    "aligned with major events.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Source:** `reddit_opinion_PSE_ISR.csv` from Kaggle  \n",
    "[Reddit on Israel–Palestine (daily updated)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/reddit-on-israel-palestine-daily-updated)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stance Framework:** Dual-target labeling approach\n",
    "- **Israel stance:** {Pro, Anti, Neutral}\n",
    "- **Palestine stance:** {Pro, Anti, Neutral}\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Stance Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generic sentiment analysis can miss target-specific positions. Stance captures \n",
    "position relative to each side, distinguishing criticism of one side from support \n",
    "of the other—even when overall sentiment is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "- How do stance proportions shift over time (monthly trends)?\n",
    "- How do patterns differ across subreddits with distinct audiences?\n",
    "- Do major events coincide with sustained changes versus short spikes?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notebook Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Loading & EDA:** Understand dataset structure, subreddit distribution, temporal patterns\n",
    "2. **Data Preparation:** Extract posts, filter communities, construct text fields\n",
    "3. **Stratified Sampling:** Generate representative sample for manual labeling\n",
    "4. **Manual Labeling:** Create gold standard dataset (~1,000 posts)\n",
    "5. **Stance Analysis:** Distributions, cross-tabs, community patterns\n",
    "6. **Baseline Modeling:** TF-IDF + Logistic Regression classifier\n",
    "7. **Temporal Analysis:** Time-series trends with event annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Language:** English posts prioritized\n",
    "- **Platform bias:** Some subreddits are highly skewed; platform averages require careful interpretation\n",
    "- **Missing communities:** r/Israel is absent from this dataset snapshot\n",
    "- **Schema evolution:** Stance definitions may be refined after initial labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reproducible analysis notebook with clear visualizations\n",
    "- Gold-labeled stance dataset for future research\n",
    "- Baseline stance classification model\n",
    "- Temporal trend analysis with event context\n",

    "**Extreme concentration:** Just three subreddits account for nearly three-quarters \n",
    "of all activity. `r/IsraelPalestine` dominates with 37.5% (1.2M comments), followed \n",
    "by `r/worldnews` at 24.7% (796K) and `r/Palestine` at 11.1% (357K). This 73% \n",
    "concentration in the top three communities suggests that aggregate platform trends \n",
    "will be heavily influenced by these specific audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steep drop-off pattern:** After the top three, participation falls sharply. \n",
    "`r/PublicFreakout` (7.5%) and `r/AskMiddleEast` (6.7%) represent the next tier, \n",
    "but even combined they don't match `r/Palestine` alone. The remaining five \n",
    "subreddits each contribute less than 5%, indicating a classic power-law \n",
    "distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Community type diversity:** The mix includes dedicated political discussion \n",
    "(`r/IsraelPalestine`), mainstream news (`r/worldnews`), advocacy-oriented \n",
    "(`r/Palestine`), viral content (`r/PublicFreakout`), regional discussion \n",
    "(`r/AskMiddleEast`), and conflict documentation (`r/CombatFootage`). This variety \n",
    "suggests different discussion styles and potential stance biases across \n",
    "communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implications for stance analysis:** The heavy weighting toward `r/IsraelPalestine` \n",
    "and `r/Palestine` means our dataset may not represent broader Reddit sentiment but \n",

    "#### Silent Majority Engagement: Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "The engagement analysis reveals fascinating patterns about where the real crowds \n",
    "are and how they participate in the Israel-Palestine discussion on Reddit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Massive silent participation:** The numbers are striking—`r/worldnews` has over \n",
    "40 million total votes despite having only 12,337 posts, while `r/Palestine` \n",
    "has 7.1 million votes across 17,412 posts. This shows that for every person \n",
    "who writes, hundreds more are reading and voting, expressing their stance \n",
    "silently through upvotes and downvotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two distinct engagement patterns emerge:**\n",
    "- **High-volume, moderate intensity:** `r/worldnews` and `r/PublicFreakout` \n",
    "  attract massive silent audiences (40M+ and 14M+ votes respectively) with \n",
    "  strong per-post engagement (51-58 votes per post)\n",
    "- **Lower volume, mixed intensity:** `r/IsraelPalestine` has fewer total votes \n",
    "  (2.4M) but represents the most balanced discussion space, while `r/Palestine` \n",
    "  shows high volume (7.1M votes) with moderate intensity (20 votes per post)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Controversy patterns:** Most subreddits show similar controversy rates (0.1), \n",
    "suggesting that Reddit's controversy algorithm flags about 10% of posts across \n",
    "communities. Notably, `r/Palestine` and `r/NonCredibleDefense` show zero \n",
    "controversy, possibly indicating more echo-chamber dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical insight for our analysis:** While `r/IsraelPalestine` might offer \n",
    "the most balanced deep conversations (low controversy, diverse discussion), \n",
    "our goal is measuring sentiment toward each entity over time. **`r/worldnews` \n",
    "represents the mainstream public opinion** with its 40+ million votes—this \n",
    "is where general Reddit users encounter and react to Israel-Palestine content. \n",
    "This massive silent majority should carry significant weight in our temporal \n",
    "sentiment analysis, as it captures broader public reaction rather than just \n",
    "the views of users specifically seeking out conflict-focused communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sampling implication:** Comments-based or engagement-weighted stratification \n",
    "would better capture this silent majority sentiment than pure posts-based \n",
    "sampling, ensuring we measure the pulse of the broader Reddit population, \n",
    "not just the most vocal participants."

    "## **Stance labeling**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why stance instead of sentiment?**\n",
    "Regular sentiment analysis tells you if someone sounds positive, negative, or neutral. But in polarized topics like Israel-Palestine, that's not enough. Someone can write angrily (negative sentiment) while defending Israel, or write sadly (negative sentiment) while supporting Palestine. We need to know *which side* they're taking, not just their emotional tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our approach: dual-target stance**\n",
    "Instead of one label per comment, we assign two:\n",
    "- **Israel stance**: How does this person feel about Israel? {Pro, Anti, Neutral/Unclear}\n",
    "- **Palestine stance**: How does this person feel about Palestine? {Pro, Anti, Neutral/Unclear}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why two separate labels?**\n",
    "People's positions can be complex:\n",
    "- Pro-Israel AND Pro-Palestine: \"Both peoples deserve safety and self-determination\"\n",
    "- Anti-Israel AND Pro-Palestine: \"Israel is an apartheid state, free Palestine\"\n",
    "- Pro-Israel AND Neutral on Palestine: \"Israel has the right to defend itself\" (no mention of Palestinians)\n",
    "- Neutral on both: \"This is a complicated situation with valid concerns on both sides\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real examples of how this works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Comment: \"The IDF bombing hospitals is a war crime, but Hamas using human shields is also wrong\"*\n",
    "- Israel stance: **Anti** (criticizes IDF actions)\n",
    "- Palestine stance: **Anti** (criticizes Hamas tactics)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Comment: \"Praying for peace for both Israelis and Palestinians 🙏\"*\n",
    "- Israel stance: **Neutral/Unclear** (supportive but not political)\n",
    "- Palestine stance: **Neutral/Unclear** (supportive but not political)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Comment: \"Israel has every right to defend itself after October 7th\"*\n",
    "- Israel stance: **Pro** (explicitly supports Israel's actions)\n",
    "- Palestine stance: **Neutral/Unclear** (Palestinians/Hamas not directly addressed)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Comment: \"Free Palestine! End the occupation!\"*\n",
    "- Israel stance: **Anti** (opposes Israeli policies)\n",
    "- Palestine stance: **Pro** (supports Palestinian liberation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**The \"Neutral/Unclear\" category**\n",
    "We use this when:\n",
    "- The comment is purely factual: \"The ceasefire was announced at 3pm\"\n",
    "- The stance is genuinely ambiguous: \"This whole situation is heartbreaking\"\n",
    "- The comment mentions the conflict but doesn't take a clear side\n",
    "- Sarcasm or complex irony that's hard to interpret definitively\n",
    "\n",
    "This dual-target approach lets us capture the nuanced reality of how people actually discuss this conflict—it's rarely simple support for one side or the other.\n"

    "### **Stratified Sampling Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is stratified sampling?**\n",
    "Instead of randomly picking 1,000 posts from our entire dataset, we divide the data into meaningful groups (strata) and sample from each group. This ensures we get balanced representation across different communities and time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use it?**\n",
    "- **Prevents bias:** Without stratification, we might accidentally get 800 samples from r/worldnews and only 10 from r/Palestine\n",
    "- **Ensures coverage:** Every month and every major subreddit gets represented\n",
    "- **Better estimates:** More accurate results than pure random sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our approach: Month × Subreddit strata**\n",
    "We create groups like:\n",
    "- \"2023-10 :: Palestine\" (October 2023 posts from r/Palestine)\n",
    "- \"2023-11 :: worldnews\" (November 2023 posts from r/worldnews)\n",
    "- \"2024-01 :: IsraelPalestine\" (January 2024 posts from r/IsraelPalestine)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How we allocate samples:**\n",
    "Each group gets samples proportional to its **total votes** (not just number of posts). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why total votes?**\n",
    "- Represents what people actually engaged with (the silent majority)\n",
    "- A post with 10,000 votes matters more than one with 10 votes\n",
    "- Captures genuine public attention, not just posting volume\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Group A: 100,000 total votes → gets 100 samples\n",
    "- Group B: 50,000 total votes → gets 50 samples  \n",
    "- Group C: 10,000 total votes → gets 10 samples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Safeguards:**\n",
    "- Every group gets at least 1 sample (no group ignored)\n",
    "- Filter r/worldnews to Israel/Palestine topics only\n",
    "- Cap any single group at 10% to prevent domination\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us a representative sample that reflects both temporal trends and genuine public engagement.\n"

    "**Evidence from manual labeling**\n",
    "- **Viral/video communities are out of scope:** `TerrifyingAsFuck`, `NoahGetTheBoat`, and `PublicFreakout` primarily host short video clips with no author framing. These posts provide engagement, not stance.\n",
    "- **General news is text‑neutral:** `worldnews` and `worldnewsvideo` consist largely of headlines and wire copy. The submission text is predominantly descriptive, yielding Neutral/Neutral labels and low informational value for stance modeling.\n",
    "- **Subreddit asymmetry:** `r/Palestine` is overwhelmingly anti‑Israel/pro‑Palestine, while `r/Israel` is absent. Including `r/Palestine` in training would encourage shortcut learning (“subreddit ⇒ stance”) and distort class balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Training focus (going forward)**\n",
    "- Prioritize stance‑rich communities: `AskMiddleEast`, `IsraelPalestine`, `IsraelPalestineWar_23`.\n",
    "- Exclude viral/video and general‑news subreddits from training; retain them only for engagement context if needed.\n",
    "- Optimize labeling yield: sufficient text (title ± selftext), de‑duplication, and per‑author limits to maintain diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rationale**\n",
    "- Concentrating on communities where authors articulate positions produces clearer labels, reduces noise, and trains models to infer stance from text rather than community identity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stratification decision (why we’re simplifying)**\n",
    "- With only three training subreddits, heavy stratification adds complexity without benefit.  \n",
    "- We will use **equal allocation across the three subreddits**, with a light temporal guard (e.g., a minimum per quarter) to ensure coverage over time.  \n",
    "- This approach is simple, transparent, preserves diversity, and is sufficient for a 500–1,000 post training set."

    "Unfortunately, this is as far as I managed to go. I picked unlabeled data and reading and labeling thousands of Reddit posts took way more time than I anticipated. I'd say I invested around 30 hours on labeling. I did it multiple times, each time labeling 1,000 posts and then realizing I had inconsistencies—sometimes it was news articles, sometimes opinions, or just viral videos. I had to take a more focused approach. I initially tried to label comments, but without the context and understanding of who each one was reacting to, it's really hard to label accurately. So I went with posts instead, and after removing all the noise and heavily biased subreddits, I'm left with ~20K posts from three stance-rich communities.\n",
